0	EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND ITS GONE TO THE DUMP. I bought this DVD Player 18 months ago and after rarely using it, it has stopped working.  It will load the DVD but will not read or play anything.  What more can I say?  Its Junk
0	Usless brick!. I tried it on 4 laptops, and none of them was able to sustain the signal. It kept on dropping out! Mind you, two of the internal cards did a much better job than it.
0	My wife says they don't last. I got these for my wife who listens to AM radio on her portable Sony radio while commuting on the bus and train, 5 days a week.  She would run through a ton of regular alkaline AAA batteries so rechargeables made sense.She has a pair of the Energizer's and a pair of Duracell's that are of the same capacity and she says that the Energizer's are terrible and hardly hold a charge.  We use a MAHA MH-C401FS charger which charges each battery independently so they don't get overcharged.  What else can you say about rechargeables?  Either they last long or they don't.  These Energizer's DO NOT.  We recently got a pair of Sony AAA's and they seem to be even better than the Duracell's
0	pre-review. I cannot review this item because it cannot be used.  It was shipped with the wrong power supply and a software disk that won't work.I have been delayed in my response because my wife died and my daughter has just been released from the hospital with the same ailment.  Since this has caused me to go over the time limit, what can I do about it now
0	Just like Kelly I can't properly review this item. My wait has been 17 weeks and I received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another 30 days.  ONE BIG DIFFERENCE!!!!  THE ITEM IS NOW LISTED AS AVAILABLE BUT FOR  MORE MONEY THAN I AGREED TO PAY BACK IN NOVEMBER.  IF THIS IS AMAZON'S WAY OF MAKING ME TAKE A WALK AND GIVE CIRCUIT CITY MY $$$, IT WORKED
0	RIP-OFF: Doesn't advertise that you need an AC adaptor. I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice
0	Nah. You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous
0	Very disappointing. I have always been a big Epson fan.  However, I have been extremely disappointed with this printer.  First of all, it burns through ink cartridges, which gets expensive.  Secondly, I am constantly having to clean the nozzle heads to prevent gaps (which uses even more ink) so that the text on my documents is legible. It's so bad I have to clean them before almost every print job, and even then I rarely get a page to print out cleanly.  Also, the printer has major problems with the paper feed - mostly when trying to print double-sided.  After *every* page I have to push the paper feed button.  Very annoying for large documents.  Finally, when printing photos or anything that has a lot of ink coverage the colors are terrible.  It's been so frustrating I am thinking of forking over for a laser printer.  Avoid buying this printer
0	Goes to Goodwill. (Don't throw out your old tv yet!). I have no clue what this little thing is about. Dummy me thought I bought a nice little tv, but it reminds me of those little cards you'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand, the image changed. That's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show. You cannot watch this thing with somebody else seated, say, 15 feet away from you. The other person (or you) gets a foggy image, or just dark shapes. Up close you see hardly anything.Buyers beware: this is not a working tv.One star for the batteries in the remote...
0	The Worst Palm I have ever had. I have owned a Palm since they were first produced by US Robotics. This is by far the worst for reliability. I never had any problems with prior models (Palm 500, Palm III, Palm IIIxe). This is the second T5 I have had. I returned the first one because it constantly locked up (just like an old windows PC), and when it was working, the hot-sync would fail a lot of the time. I am ready to send the replacement they sent me back because the battery lasts about 2 DAYS even when I am not using it. Then I have a hard time getting it to turn on. I usually have to leave it plugged in for an extended period of time until it finally decides to turn itself on. What a waste of money. I wish I still had my Palm IIIxe
0	Don't waste your money; you don't need a tool to open a CD easily!. As a musician who's dealt w/ opening many CD packages for many years, let me save you some money.  You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.Getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the CD off is easy, too.  Again, no tools required.  You'll notice that the CD cover is "hinged" at the top & bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back.  It just pops in & out, held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other.   Gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top & bottom, then bend the whole thing back, toward the top of the CD case where the sticker is affixed, so that the sticker becomes straightened out.  This will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece.  (Try peeling the front cover off the sticker, rather than vice versa.)  And you're done!  All you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy.The whole process takes under a minute, and you'll still have the money in your pocket that you didn't spend on an iffy CD opening tool, to buy another CD with
0	Slower and full of problems!. I had the sportrak color for about a year and loved it before I lost it. I got the Explorist 500 as a replacement. At first, I didn't like it because they took away alot of the menus and I was afraid of having a proprietary rechargeable battery. Then I got used to it although it navigates/zooms more slowly than my Sportrak did. What I liked the least was the compass didn't correct itself when I turned without walking like the Sportrak did - the Sportrak moved like a real compass! I kind of got used to that but after about 8 months of use it started giving me "Invalid Basemap" errors when starting up most of the time. I have tried the online support with Magellan and they have been very slow and haven't helped at all. I will be calling them shortly to see if I get any help there. There are a few other minor things I dislike such as not being able to modify geocaching waypoints without connecting to my pc. I am considering a Garmin replacement if Magellan can't help me resolve this issue
0	JVC used to be reliable - not any more :(. Pros: it's prettyCons: it's garbageSure wished I had checked here at Amazaon before I bought this - I can't believe JVC put out such garbage!  So many of these CD players have broken that they can't keep up with the replacement parts (5 week wait?!!)I guess I was one of the luckier ones - mine lasted almost 2 months before it died.Bottom line: if you haven't bought yet, look elsewhere.  If you have, keep your receipt and warranty handy..
0	Poor range. I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard.  It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting "fix" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.  This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations.  If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere
0	really crummy software interface. Transferring the first album to my PC took roughly 5 hours. The second took 3.5 hours, the third about 2 hours and the fourth about 1.5 hours.Learning the software interface took an inordinate amount of time, even though I've been an interface programmer.After learning the software, it appears every album will cost about an hour to record, mark the songs, name the songs and write the songs as MP3. If I want to edit out song parts or eliminate pops/clicks, it will take longer.It's really time consuming and the software doesn't make it simple or intuitive.The turntable is of reasonable quality. It's just a regular turntable with a built-in pre-amp. You turn the pre-amp `on' when recording to your PC, turn if `off' if you want to use the turntable with your regular stereo
0	2 Flaws in Excel. everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel: on the numpad, the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key.  this is unacceptable, i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games.  logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products, but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings.  i will never buy logitech again
0	Awful. The fidelity is not very good. I din't expect all that much, but the real problem is that the cord is too long to work well with an Ipod. The cord tangles like crazy and the offset lengths to accomodate the volume control make the headset clumsy. I just quit using the headphones in favor of the stock ipod ones
0	very disappointing for a cisco product or linksys. most of the claims made on the description require a service. so the service costs a fortune compared to the camera.  the basic management software that came with it is bad.  its old and no updates available. many features are unavailable and if you actuate the drive space limitation the whole setup is trashed and you have to start over in setting up again.  Some of the features that dont work are the ablilty to name cameras and it sometimes just misses one of the 4 cameras for no apparent reason.  The hard sold "feature" of emailed info from a motion sensor and being able to check vids from the internet is the service. Shame on the maker for selling a partly disabled product and then asking a monthly fee to make it work
0	Don't buy it. The SonicStage is really a disaster. I have been using MZ-RH910 for a year, and I use it for recording music lessons. When I upload my files to computer to back them up, I alway have some recordings (about 15%)unreadable by SonicStage, even though I can listen to them with the MiniDV. What can I do with those recordings? I can only leave them in the MD walkman. If my MZ-RH910 is broken, I have to buy another one in order to listen to those recordings. Obviously I will never buy Sony's recorder again.
0	Do not work as well as promised. I live in Washington DC, so I generally get a signal when outdoors.  Using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me
0	DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!. My drive FAIL after one year and a half...!!! This company really suck BIG TIME....I lost all of my data ...!!! ALL OFF IT...!!! THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR!!!  Total JUNK...!!! NEVER buy a LACIE AGAIN FOR SURE....MAXTOR EXTERNAL IS THE BEST!!
0	MADE IN CHINA: Look elsewhere. The highest volume setting is barely audible.The options are limited.More profit for an American company at the expense of Americans.
0	Read All Reviews Before Purchasing This Card. I, along with many others, have experienced "sound lock-ups", squeals and computer lock-ups with this card and the others in this series.  My sound issues have occurred mostly during games.Sound quality is excellent in Windows and when the card is working properly in games.Most of the issues appear to involve some kind of hardware conflict as most afflicted users have high-end computer systems running SLI, although the problems are not exclusive to these configurations.I am currently working with CL to resolve the issue, but I'm not sure they know what is causing it as this issue has been around since Aug 06.I am not saying "don't buy", just be sure you have fully investigated all the issues before making the purchase as I doubt your installation and use with be trouble free
0	Nice projector but bad odor. I recently bought this projector (not through Amazon) and ended up having to return it.  It has a persistent burning odor.  I thought it would go away after an hour or two, but three days later and many hours, it was just as bad.  It was so bad that my wife opened up the windows in our house and it was in the 20s outside.I liked everything else about the projector.  It was light and fairly small.  The fan was quite and the picture was bright.  If it didn't smell so bad, I would have kept it
0	Bogus review request. I've replied to this request three times. The product was returned to vendor and cc charges were reversed
0	Not everything. Read the plan carefully.  Not everything is covered under this plan.  They will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they don't have to pay.  Too many exclusions for an "everything is covered policy"  Don't waste your mone
0	Another Fuse... It came with the stickers all peeling off. Used it for about a month and the item failed on me. Then the bad news, it blew the fuses in my car and all my electronics stopped working. Tried it on a friends car and I blew his fuses (car and person). Look for something else. Seems to be a common problem.UPDATE: Linksys replaced this product instantly. Works but a little worried it will fail again.UPDATE ON UPDATE: Died again...
0	Don't waste your money... In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent.I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems
0	I like the "un-improved" ones better. The old Koskin design is great. I have 5 and just logged on to order one for a friend and am quite disappointed to see the changes, so... my friend will be getting something else. The way the old handle was attached was very cool, a selling point. Plus the mesh in the handle made orderly labeling easy and attractive. The "OLD' Koskin material was pretty cool too. If all this has changed - find something else - no reason to stick with Case Logic for average stuff. You can get no-name discount junk everywhere. Hope Case Logic reads this.
0	Poor quality control, even worse Sharp customer service. I ordered this television with high hopes, knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that I would luck out and save a bundle.  But you get what you pay for.  Every Sharp Aquos LCD TV manufactured before April 1, 2006 shipped with bad firmware.  What does this mean to you?For me, it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the TV and turning it on, it turned itself off and never turned back on again.  Resets, system resets, power cycling, unplugging components didn't help.  My TV was completely bricked.  A search turned up threads on websites like AVS Forum with other owners of Sharp TVs in the D4U and D6U series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase.  For them, the fix was a visit to a Sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the TV.  I say a "visit" because Sharp does not cover in-house technician visits for TVs under 32", a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled.So here I am, 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no TV to show for it.  Instead, it sits at the authorized service center (because Sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either).I'm willing to bet all of the inventory of D6Us that TigerDirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4/1/2006.  Check the serial number on your TV if you do order one.  If it begins with a 501-512, 601, 602 or 603, immediately demand a firmware upgrade from Sharp (1-800-BE-SHARP), regardless of whether or not you're experiencing these issues; you will eventually, and hopefully while Sharp's warranty is still in effect for you.

0	Gets rid of dust and fingerprints, but leaves a mess. The other two reviewers got it mostly right.  But let me make it clear: this lightly moistened wipes can indeed remove fingerprints and dust -- and even prevent dust build-up for a few days.  The problem is, when the cleaning liquid dries, it leaves ugly fog-like marks on your LCD screen.  I've found out that after it dries, using a lint-free soft cloth to lightly polish the screen helps clean up the screen completely.  But then, I could have just used the cloth to remove cust and fingerprints.I think these wipes can be helpful when you have serious fingerprints or dirt (not just dust) on your LCD screen.  Otherwise, for most people, this is just a waste of money and can actually make you frustrated
0	Didn't help a bit. I bought this to extend the range of my access point in my 1500 sq ft flat.  I had my access point at the far end of the house from where I wanted to connect some of the time.  This antenna made no difference.  I ended up moving my access point to resolve the problem
0	remote woes. It is to hard to set up with other TVS other then Sony TV
0	Not for use on Treadmill. I bought these headphones to watch TV while on the treadmill. They don't work at all for that purpose. Interference from the motor causes them to cut-out. They work great when I stop the treadmill
0	It won't work!!. I have a corded USB wireless antenna from Linksys that keeps falling off the table, so I thought I'd give this 'great new wireless' card a shot.I got it today and all the things the other reviewers said is happening to me also.It connects and then automatically disconnects.I tried NOT using their driver disc and letting Windows (XP) set it up (like the Linksys one did) and it forces me to use their driver, which won't work.I'm sending it back
0	Did not see any difference. I did not see any picture quality improvement using this high priced Monster cable. I get the same quality pictures from my $ 8.00 cable bought from biglots. So purchased a HDMI cable. But believe me. The picture quality from my cheap component cable is still good( eventhough HDMI pictures are little better) when I compared with the pictures from HDMI cable
0	No Good For Students. I am a student in a technology high school, and when I saw that this bag would fit my laptop, and what looked like room for my books, I was in for a shock.Initially, it was fine, but after a month or so of use, a small hole began to form, which recently formed into a large hole. Now, the whole handle part of the bag is coming off.It is a good bag, but it is poorly designed for any student, in my opinion, who needs to carry both a laptop and a large number of text books
0	Buyers! Beware of Lexar's rebate claims. I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again
0	Junk!. Replaced first spindle and still junk. Will always stick with Verbatim from now on
0	Throw-away player. Bought it. Played a DVD on it for 2 hours and the unit failed.  Other DVD players in the house have had no problems at all and have worked non-stop for years.Save yourself time and money.  Purchase a quality item instead of this throw-away player
0	Great service if you never plan on canceling. I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player
0	I drops. This product was useless. I was trying to fix my screen and all it did was make things worse. I got a microfiber cloth and everything and nothing seemed to happen. It's not worth the money.
0	Expensive, not good quality. I bought it and used it for two days, returned it on the third day.  Very expensive for what you get.  The system does not come with an amplifier where you can adjust the sound.  The surround sound is non-existant and for 499 you don't get that much.Returned it and changed for a Sony DAV-DX375 which totally rocks !!Don't buy this, you will be very dissapointed
0	BEWARE SAMSUNG DLP DESIGN FLAWS!!!. Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to "turn it off", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!I have a 42" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP
0	Don't Bother. This product is useless. I purchased it because I have the new Ipod video player- which is a little more fragile then the previous.. well- I see this product which I thought would be great. but- It most certainly is not! Its awful. There were air pockets all over- and no matter how much I tried, my brother tried- or my friends- the air pockets would not go away. If you want air pockets all over your viewing screen then get this.. if not- I would suggest somthing different! This is horrible and a waste of money!!!
0	I am unable to verify its ultra high performance. ~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it.
0	I paid it but I never received it. Dear Amazon, I paid for this but until today I did not received it, I wrote to the supplier and until today I did not received any answer from him
0	A portable device IDEAL for NON PORTABLE computers. Looks sleek, runs fast on my dual opteron with Suse 10.1.Reformatted to ext3 very well.Unfortunately, it will not work on my Dell Precision M50, not enough power on the USB port I guess. I wish it had an optional connector for a power supply. Now I will have to hack the cable. Waste of time :(
0	Better options out there... This battery has 1800mah while the Sony has 2100mah... go for the Sony
0	Overpriced. As for digital technology, monster cable has once again ruined the marketplace by greatly over estimating what their products are worth.  The great difference with the digital output/inpt devices compared to analog is simple.  If the digital signal reaches the device it needs to it can't be any more or less clear.  Because your digital signal is comprised of "0's" and "1's" if you can see your TV or hear the music then what ever cable you use works-  There is no distortation across digital signals, so don't pay the extra money- In fact you shouldn't need to spend more than around $30-50.
0	Does not work with large SD cards. Buyer beware.  This reader does not work with large SD cards.  I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card.  My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work.  I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet
0	Was not needed. Based on my research for the Logitech Harmony 890 remote, I thought I needed the extender.  That is not the case.  The extender comes with the remote.  The return process was a nightmare, because of Amazon's third party retailers.  Beware when purchasing throught the third party retailers, the rules of return and customer satisfaction change!  EVENTUALLY, Amazon resolved all issues, but it didn't happen in their normally easy manner
0	Unacceptable. This model was intended as a replacement for my not-very-old and yet quite functional Panasonic PM-series stereo.  This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night.Unfortunately, with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality, the Sony is in all respects inferior; ergonomics, appearance, and above all, FM reception, which is laughably poor.  Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver.  Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony
0	Fellow Brand Shredders. I purchased a Fellowes Shredder and felt it shredding money right out of my wallet. If you ever disasmbled a Fellow shredder, you would come to see that they use cheap plastic parts where sturdy mechanical parts made of metal are needed, this is why most of their products fail and their customer service is as good as their cheap parts.  I took mine apart as it was useless and time consuming to deal with returns and their customer service.There are many other brands of shredders out there and Fellowes is the worst, so save your money and buy another brand.  Fellows is sure no fellow
0	Very flaky, contrary to Viking's reputation for quality. I've owned various Viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance, until I purchased this 2 GB CompactFlash card.It's possible that this card works well in other uses, but I found its performance unacceptable as storage for RAW images shot with my Canon Digital Rebel SLR.  Anywhere from 1/5 to 1/10 of the images were corrupted, particularly bad in continuous shooting mode.  Contrast with my Lexar Media 512 MB and 1 GB cards, which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions, and without as much of a lag time as the Viking card (often left waiting 15+ seconds after shooting as few as 3 continuous images while the card to "recovers")
0	They denied the rebate request, what a rip-off!. Your rebate submission has been received.Unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons:REQUEST POSTMARKED AFTER CLOSE OF PROGRAM DEADLINEREQUIRED POSTMARK BEFORE 09/10/04; ACTUAL POSTMARK 09/13/04***********************************************There was absolutely no cut-off submission deadline given, except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase.All were followed to the "T".I submitted the rebate immediately after I received the merchandise from Amazon.Give me a break, I'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10' pole.If it was not so piddling an amount, this would be worth reporting to FCC, but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops, probably for nothing, more heartache.Just forego rebates, send Viking back to the boat and purchase another brand
0	Could NOT Get This Remote to Work. I bought this remote to use with my Ipod 20G with Clickwheel and, despite installing as instructed, I could not get this to operate. It fit the Ipod very well, so I figured I would not have a problem.  I have also used Maxell products in the past and also haven't had any problems. The remote lit up, but it would not operate any of the functions when I pointed it at my Ipod.  Maybe this is a great product and I did something wrong, but it is easy to install and mine would not work.  I returned the remote to Amazon as defective and received a refund for it.  Again, this might be a great product, but I wanted to write a review to warn other customers that I had problems with it
0	Too buggy. I have a Linksys wrt54g wireless router with 5 notebooks, a printer, and 2 desktops all working without problem through Comcast cable. I use WEP and MAC address filtering. Linksys support very kindly spent about two hours trying to help me get this supposedly compatible phone to work, but it can not connect to the wireless router. I think they rushed this to market before it was ready
0	Confortable but the sound is poor. I don't recommend you to buy this item, its sound is poor, and there is a static noise when the car engine is on.
0	CruzerSynch Doesn't Work--No Support. As a dumb hard drive this is 1GB for more money than you need to spend. The "U3 CruzerSynch" preloaded application has never been able to transfer the Contact list from my Outlook Express, it crashes...everytime. It's also better to use SyncToy from MS because CruzerSynch only synchs (deletes files deleted from the HD) while SyncToy has a "Contribute" option that never deletes from the destination drive. I contacted "support" I sent them the requested copy of my wab; they've been "working" on it for weeks, I never expect to hear from them. CruzerSynch also, without warning, deleted my address book (Contacts) from my HD. Not good
0	Great but Hard to get use to. The Z-Board is great. But If you are playing Battlefield 2 and then switch to the ZBoard you are in a fix. The controls are totally different and very hard to get use to. If you start with it, it might be alright but I think the regular keyboard will be just fine
0	wrong item. The item is fine.  It was the wrong DC adaptor for the Garmin unit purchased.  It was listed along the Garmin unit as the correct one for the unit.  It was for another Garmin line of products.  I'm sure it worked well on the correct product
0	don't buy this!. When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth
0	Almost impossible to use with large-capacity iPods. I have this cable installed on a CDA-9856 deck, using a 60GB iPod Photo. The interface completely circumvents everything that is good about the interface on the iPod itself.1. The controls and display on the iPod are disabled when connected the head unit. You MUST use the head unit to control the iPod, and you cannot see information about the currently playing track on the iPod.2. When searching through artists, albums, songs, or playlists on the deck, only one item is viewable at a time (contrasted with 5 or 6 items viewable on the iPod screen itself). This makes it extremely dangerous to browse through your music while driving if you don't already know exactly what you want to listen to.3. One "tick" of the control knob on the deck scrolls through 1 item (artist/album/song/playlist) on the iPod. Scrolling does not speed up as you continue to turn the knob. If you want to scroll through 200+ artists, expect to spend fully 2 minutes or more twiddling the knob. While driving. I can't even begin to describe how frustrating this is.4. There is absolutely no way to speed up the process: there is no fast scrolling mode that skips through 10+ artists at a time, there is no way to scroll by letter of the alphabet, no nothing.5. When scrolling through items, the menu returns to the beginning of the list each time you pull it up. If you spend 90 seconds scrolling to "New Order", then next you want to listen to something by Nirvana, have fun scrolling for another 90 seconds.It's as if Alpine didn't bother to user test this system AT ALL with large-capacity iPods. It's a complete embarassment and I will be returning it as soon as possible
0	You get what you pay for. These are $10 headphones. There's nothing amazing about them in my opinion.  I bought them to use with my ipod when I'm out, or at work.Right out of the box, I was disappointed with the fit, and I know everyone is going to be different, but for me they just aren't comfortable.The sound quality is clear, but very thin and lacking bass. Even when I'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit, the bass just isn't good. EQ settings to boost the bass don't help either, and often reduce sound quality even more.The ear clips don't really seem to do that much either.  They kind of keep them on your ears but don't really hold them IN your ears at all.  The ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well.In summary, I wouldn't recommend these for music, but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word, they might be good-IF you can tolerate them in your ears for that long
0	the ability to pause during recording?. Am I missing something, or does this unit NOT allow you to pause during a recording? When I try to use the pause button during recording (using DVD-R to record a program), a message pops up saying "That function prohibited during record mode." And when I check the user manual, the only thing it says regarding the "Pause" button on the remote is that it is used to "pause during playback." A recorder with NO PAUSE feature for editing on the fly? What if you want to edit commercials while recording? What if you're dubbing from home videos and you want to pause to edit out unwanted segments? Seems to me that's either really bad design or a rather remarkable oversight.
0	Good printer when it works. First, the print quality is very good.  When it does work, it seems to work very well.  I was pleased with the print quality and features, and the print speed is excellent.But the real problem is the extremely unstable software.  More than half the time, I could not start a scanning operation without it failing.  And when it fails, it really fails, and the only way to get it back working again is to pull the plug on the printer (that's right - the power button won't turn off the printer power when this happens), AND restart the computer which was the target of the scan output.   Since I normally do a fair amount of scanning, this meant most days having to reboot both printer and computer, just to do a simple scanning job.The printing software was also iffy, although not nearly the problem as was the scanner software.   Probably 10% of the time, a print job would not complete.The HP Image software which came with the printer was a very useful and straight-forward photo-processing tool, which I would recommend for the most part.  HP chose, however, to ignore all the normal Windows software conventions, (like having a File and Edit menu at the top of the screen), so you are always having to hunt around on-screen for what you want to do.Bottom line:  I hate playing the "print/scan lottery", wondering whether my print or scan job will actually work, each time I try to print or scan something.   This is not a finished product, and I strongly recommend buying something else
0	Great idea, bad product. Big disappointment. The product does not work in my view. I have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95% of the cases. It is not much different than entering the information manually. The character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective. Does not even recognize that "wireless" is the mobile phone number. One would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years. The only good thing is once you scan the cards, you can throw them away, but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand.
0	Charger is fine, Transmitter is awful. There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger.  It works fine.  However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me.  1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case.  2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars.  I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality
0	Construction quality below expected. I've bought one of the 12c platinum because I needed a calculator in my office. I don't do financial calculations, so probably I'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics, but I like RPN and the programmable features.Build quality is below expected: intro key responsiveness is different than other keys', the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted, so the calculator is slightly unstable.With the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece.Disappointed
0	decent sound but zero comfort. I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine.However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are "uncomfortable as sin". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return.If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere..
0	Did not charge. I purchased the Garmin Forerunner 201 but when I received the watch it would charge so I have not been able to use it and now it is back with the manufacturer.  Garmin warranty is for 1 year so everthing should work out but I have not received it back yet so I do not have too much to say.
0	Beware if buying this in S.F. Bay Area, and you use Comcast. The reason is, this product isn't listed in the Comcast list of TV's that they can program their remote to.  What that means is you have to use two remotes, and if this isn't bad enough - when you call comcast up to get a signal, they won't/can't do it.  So here's where I am now - and I've had the TV for about two weeks now:  No picture, after watching a DVD, I'm unable to switch it back to TV mode.  Because there's no companion remote to do it on.  After several long minutes with the Comcast tech, trying to get her to just send me a signal, I couldn't take it anymore.  I asked for a tech to come to the house, and got an appointment for 11/7.  So another week goes by with no picture.  The screen tells me "No Signal."  After a few seconds of this message it flashes to ""Please  Scan Channels."
0	outrageous price for sb5100. the average going price for this product is $50.-$60.  the price quoted herein of $600. is so far beyond what might be considerable reasonable it's ludicrous.  doesn't Amazon have any standards for their third party vendors?  whether or not you disclaim responsibility for third party suppliers, they do appear on Amazon's web site, and nothing will prevent Amazon from being associated with such chicanery. allowing such postings is unworthy of Amazon.  for a number of years i have held an equity position in Amazon, and fully understand, and generally approve of using additional sources for products your customers want, and i do understand the meaning of caveat emptor, but this is an embarrassment
0	lousy sound quality, even at $43.99. I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled.I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button
0	That's it?  A $6 dollar cable and a $14 cable?. I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables.  Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper.  Just ridiculous.  The Airport Express itself is fantastic, but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable, and a quick search online for the optical to mini
0	A $10 toy piano has better sound than this. For the price ($80) I expected much better sound.  Should spend a little more and get a Shoenhut or for $10 you could get a toy piano that sounds better than this one.  Very tinny sound, completely out of tune (why do they bother even assigning a note to the keys?), and lid is attached with screws AND glue so the only way to get to the metal rods to attempt to tune it, even after the screws are removed, will be to crack the wood casing getting past the glue
0	Don't buy.  Terrible terrible product. Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought.  It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work.  Don't buy.
0	Needs Improvement. I bought one of these and returned it a couple days later (from an electronics store - much more expensive than @ Amazon).  While it had many qualities I was looking for, like the thick, protected connector for the ipod instead of a dangling wire, this unit just didn't do a good job of holding a charge.  I followed all the instructions, charge it overnight, etc. but still it would only give and extra hour or so battery life to my 40 gig ipod.  As tempting as this one is, I'd say pass and find one with proven ability to hold a charge
0	I whish I'd received written conformation!. I paid for it and got an e-mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation. Called the 1800#. It's been a month. If it's this hard to get the plan I wonder how it will be if I need to replace my product
0	do not buy 2 of these!!. I bought 2 for 2 to race, but only one 'rumbles". I have called Logitech tech support and they said, "oh,well,that's the way it was designed". Nowhere on the box or the instructions does it say that and it is very illogical. I will not buy Logitech gaming products again
0	Wouldn't work on my computer. The hook up and downloading the software was very simple.  There was a error problem with the drivers.  My computer is fairly new with windows xp.  I called there support and was told to try it on another computer. I install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened. I sent it back to Amazon and credit my account, and bought an other brand.  Amazon is so great about handling returns.
0	MISREPRESENTED KEYBOARD. I am under the impression that I have been swindled:   Microsoft on its packaging, and Amazon in its web writeup, announce this as a "REMOTE KEYBOARD FOR WINDOWS XP MEDIA CENTER EDITION".I have both a VAIO Laptop with XP Media Center Edition, and a PC with MS Media Center Edition, but neither will work with this Keyboard.The small print inside the box says I have to buy a 'MEDIA CENTER PC EQUIPPED WITH THE PROPER MS RECEIVER...!"  for this to connect to.  Absolutely preposterous.   Nowhere outside the box, nor in Amazon's desciption, is there a warning that this SEVERE limitation exists.So what do I do with this keyboard now?Can somebody supply me with a receiver I can connect to my PC?Or have I really been swindled
0	Unit keeps reporting Incorrect password. Dispite having a confirmed that I have working Skype account (tested via a computer and USB phone)... the CIT400 (which has been correctly set up as per all included instructions), keeps returning an "incorect password" message every time I try to log into Skype with it..(no, I am not trying to log in when my PC is logged into Skype and yes I am sure that I've keyed in the correct Skype name and password into the phone).Linksys outsourced tech support is USELESS...They can do no more then rundown the same checklist that you can find yourself...it all comes down to reset the phone, reset the base station...and it DOES NOT WORK.I'm sure that there has to be an identifiable reason for this to be happening but I'll be returning the phone if Skype tech support (who I hope just might have a clue) can offer no suggestions.
0	Cheap, Not Inexpensive. The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews. I was never able to get the card to do anything. I tried removing and reinstalling the drivers. I tried getting assistance through the web site. I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call. I've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card
0	Seems a good idea, but poorly put togeter. I purchased 16 of the Allsop 26625 DVD/VHS Organizers. After I had 4 or 5 of them on the floor, loaded with DVDs, I was going to move them to load the next batch. But, when I picked them up off the floor, two of them came apart, dropping the DVDs on the floor. Knowing they were weak, I tried to hold the next one together, but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners; the other two corners gave way, and my hands came together, scattering DVDs all over the floor.Looking at the pieces that came apart, I saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece. But the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the DVDs facing upward, and they were the same on all 16 boxes.I emailed the manufacturer (from whom I had bought 12 of the boxes) and asked, since it would be time-consuming for me to send them back, and costly for them, what would they offer me if I just kept them and glued the corners together. I had absolutely no response.I ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart, glueing the 112 attachment points and reassembling them. I think they will be OK, now, but I would not have purchased them if I knew they were so poorly manufactured. And, I do not have any good thoughts about Allsop's customer service
0	Good idea; lousy execution... I have mixed feelings about this product.  The idea behind it is fine--keep all of your CDs/DVDs in one place, away from too much handling.  The problem is that the Sony implementation is mediocre at best.  The user interface is *terrible*; so bad you almost can't believe that they'd release a product like this.  You need a keyboard to do anything reasonable, and the "Load info from DVD" feature barely works.  And when it does, it's wrong and uneditable.  The remote control is so poorly laid out that it's almost comical.  The most important button, to get a list of your DVDs, is labeled "Folders" and is tiny and in a bad location.  Plus once all your DVDs are loaded, then what?  You only can support one TV...I have other TVs and a DVD player in the car, so I either have to unload them (and the device forgets everything), or have to copy all the DVDs that I need to use on multiple machines.If you are not sure whether to get this, I'd consider buying your movies from iTunes and using an AppleTV, or some other similar model.  You might also consider any fair use provisions that let you keep a copy of the DVDs you rightfully own for permanent insertion into this device (although the interface is still absolutely horrible).If the remote and user interface were actually functional and elegant, I'd probably feel differently about this product
0	Linux Users Beware. I purchased this card after borrowing a card with an identical product number from a friend. My friend's card worked out of the box with my version of Ubuntu Linux.When I received my card, it simply did not work. After doing some research, I found that I had a card with a different version number, and a different chipset. My friend's card had a chipset made by Atheros, which worked out of the box. The card that I purchased had a Broadcom chipset, which is notorious for being incompatible with Linux. Even after going to the forums, I was unable to make the card work.Belkin is dishonest, in that it makes changes to the chipset without changing the product number, only the version number, which the consumer is not made aware of. Had I been aware that the card had a different chipset, I would not have ordered it
0	This stopped working after about a week. When I was christmas shopping, I thought this looked really cute, and I figured, "Hey, it's cheap, and looks good."  So I bought it.  It worked pretty well for the first couple of days, and then the CD playing system on it just decided to stop working.  I checked all things that I might have possibly done wrong, but I didn't find any.  When you try to load the CD, it doesn't let you play anything.  I would not recomend this product for whoever wants to buy it, because it did not work like I wanted it to, and it made a pretty lousy Christmas present after I found out it had broken.  DON'T BUY THIS
0	caution-device may be responsible for phone line noise. In retrospect, I am not sure how well this worked. As another reviewer stated below, after a couple of years, when using my cordless phone, I started to hear static, then eventually, I heard a very loud, annoying pulse tone which the person I called also heard.Assuming the line noise was due to my phone/DSL line, I called my telephone service provider to check the line. I was thinking of changing my DSL line filters or buying a new phone (assuming some problem with my Panasonic 2.6 GHz phone). When I figured out this device was responsible, the Zapper went immediately into the garbage.Not sure what started the problems (bad battery?, latent defect?). In the end, am not sure how effective this device is as I still received plenty of unsolicited calls. In any case, this device was not worth the trouble and cost.
0	no radio reception. sound is fine for Ipod music. The radio stations do not come in. One local station tunes to all.  Our $20 Boom box gets better reception
0	I'd rate a "0" if I could. If there was more detail from Amazon, I would have never bought this item. To me, the whole point of buying a docking station is so I don't have to lug around the power pack in and out of my laptop case. This docking station didn't come with a power pack!!! A USB port hub will almost be as good as this docking station - with the exception of a place to hook the monitor. I tried to go generic - but at the end of the day, but a docking station that is made for your specific laptop by your laptop manufacturer. You will be much happier in the long run
0	BEWARE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY. This adapter will not work with certain drivers goto pharos website for details.  I bought this product fought it for 8 hours before I figured this out and had to return it
0	Did not deliver. I purchased for about $8 the 1-year Replacement Plan for Electronics Products on 07-06-2006 and after one call on about 08-06-2006 to the seller I still have *not* received anything. --John
0	Coasters!. I wish they had a rating for zero stars.  I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters.  That's a 24% success rate.  I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters.  Memorex has really gone downhill.
0	BEWARE of Kingston REBATES!. Beware of KINGSTON rebates!Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1  business cards when flattened.  No problem.About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer."Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams
0	Are you kidding???  Good sound from a $5 pair of headphones???. Com'on folks...let's be real here.  The Coby CV-H42 headphones may have decent sound for a pair of cheap headphones, but com'on...they're only $5 or less.  I've tried them on a non-amplified computer monitior at work, and they sound decent.  The bass is average at best.  If these have a 40mm driver, then I'd hate to hear what a smaller one in a Coby set would sound like.I've also tried them on my at-home 5.1 amplified PC set-up and they distort way too easily.  The bass distorts at almost the slightest bit of bass.And I concur with those who say that it's a roll of the dice to get a good working pair, as the left-speaker in my set is a bit weak.I mean let's face it...these are some pretty cheap headphones...if you want a cheap, but great sounding pair of headphones, you better look to a set in the $15+ range.  Take for instance the KOSS KTX-PRO 1 Titaniums for $18 here on Amazon.  They're sold for upwards of $45 at retailers like Radio Shack.  And from all the glowing reviews, they're a hellava set of headphones.I gave this set 2-stars only because they're decent for a cheap pair, but for audiophiles, stear clear
0	Ear Piercing. The drive has great capacity and works fast enough. However, after seeking it makes a very high pitched noise. It is not even that loud and yet I can't stand it at all. Would not recommend based on this if you have any kind of sensitive hearing. Additionally the drive has no means to set it to run slower but with less noise unlike other drives
0	They work, but they are painful to wear. They are decent headphones sound quality wise. I have very complaints in that department. However, even after a few minutes, they can become very painful to wear. I suppose you get what you pay for, but usually Philips is better than this. Needless to say, I plan on returning them.Also, just a side note, the current picture featured in this product listing is not what the headphones look like. I'm not sure what model those headphones are, but the actual SHP2500 look nothing like that. Hopefully Amazon will fix that soon.-Edit: Amazon has updated this product listing now. The picture now matches what the headphones actually look like
0	Save your money. Let me come straight to the point. This stuff is garbage. Please save your hard earned cash, and purchase something different. This does nothing to remove or repair scratches. If you want to waste 10 dollars, you can rip up a 10 dollar bill and flush it down the toilet. If I could rate this item as zero stars, then I would.
0	Great, but... My friend has this cord to connect his iPod to his stereo, and it works great, great sound, good ease of use etc. I wanted one so I went to Bestbuy today and got one by RCA that sounds just as good for $7.99
0	JUNK!. This is an extremely cheap product (poor grade of plastic) and sound quality is...for the lack of a better word...gross! The earbuds that came with my ipod are 10 times better! It's on it's way back! STAY AWAY
0	DON' T BUY!!! Very poor quality!! On my 3rd Set. I originally purchased this HDTV back in September but it had to be replaced because the digital tuner(ATSC) was defective and the ATSC would crash while i was watching digital TV so the picture would freeze and i would have to restart the TV to watch digital TV.Olevia replaced that defective tv with a new tv same model and it worked fine for about 2 months now it has an unsightly thin vertical blue line going threw the middle of the screen. So now olevia has to replace my tv for a second time in 6 months. I've never experienced such poor quality electronics in my life and I will never buy another product from olervia-syntax. I would give this product 0 stars if i could. DONT buy this (...).
0	dont buy not worth a cent. got it at walmart can't even remove a scuff. i give it -100 good thing i could return it
0	a few key pointers to read before purchasing. okay. Your first pointer: Do Not Buy. I have been plaing the guitar for 1.5 years but I will tell you I did not start out on this guitar. My neighbors have one and somtimes i'll try to tune it but it dosn't matter because they never play it. the strings never stay tuned and they are horrible quality strings. I own a Gibson Les Paul Epephone. It is my third guiar. Do not even buy your child a guitar unless they are interested. A way you can tell is, How creative are they? How often do they use thier right brain? If they are interested you have to spend atleast $115 for a nice guitar. My eleven year old self hopes that this helped you/ Thank you very much.
0	Good Light, Short Life. This is a very well designed light and works very well. You have better control of the light vs. snake neck light types. The quailty of light put out is good and is not so bright as to create glare. There is one major flaw in this light. It has a very short life span. It died after only two months
0	Buy a laser fax instead. I was suprised and dismayed to learn that this Brother FAX-575 is among the most popular fax machines Amazon sells.  The print and copy quality are inadequate, the machine shrieks in an especially tiresome manner, and the overpriced ribbons need frequent replacement.  Even at the highest resolution setting, recipients of my faxes complain about not being able to make out even typed text.  The dusty old laser fax I paid five dollars for at a garage sale takes much longer-lasting toner cartridges and completely outclasses the FAX-575.  The 575 is, however, a surprisingly adequate phone, with exceptional volume and voice quality.  Go figure
0	Good audio, lousy handset interface. Once again, a consumer electronics hardware maker proves that they can't develop a good software interface for their device. In terms of physical design, this is one of the best cordless phones out there. The sound quality is also quite good, and the DECT technology works on a band that keeps it free of WiFi interference. However, I had to return this phone right away because the interface is so awful. First of all, Philips really shortchanged this device by putting in a cheap LCD display that can only display 8 letters on caller ID, and then they are letters formed in barely legible block-style on the numerical display. I mean, how much more would if have cost them to put in a modern LCD display with enough pixels to show real letters? But the clincher is the poor design of this phone's Caller ID interface. Call it Caller Confusion. If you have Caller ID with Name service from your phone company, with this phone you can only see the name -- and only the first 8 letters of it! While the phone call is coming in, there is no way to scroll the display to show the phone number. You can only see that AFTER the phone has stopped ringing. What use is that? If the incoming phone call actually has a name from the phone company, this is barely OK, but for the many calls that have no name, this phone will show "CELL PHO" or "UNKNOWN" or "800 SERV". There is no way to get it to show the actual number while the phone is still ringing. If you're trying to screen calls, it's essentially useless. Whoever designed this interface just doesn't get what Caller ID is for in the first place. I would have loved to like this phone, because I think the phones from Panasonic, VTech, Motorola and others are horribly ugly, and my previous Panasonic had the worst audio quality imagnable. But this phone doesn't cut it as well. Why is the cordless phone market so devoid of good products
0	HMMMMMMMM................. Well... first off let me say that I don't usually write review's. But, I had to on this product.. and not because it is great.... ITS HORRIBLE.. the reception is awful.... I hooked it up and tried every station possible... but to no avail. I had to turn the volume up extremely high... and the background noise is torture to the ears !! With all the crackling and static... I am very disappointed.... very !! I am just going to burn all my songs to disc's...  or buy a plug and play receiver... I wish it didn't have to come to this  ... darn it.
0	absolute junk. I have had nothing but trouble with this product. no matter how many times i have dowload new, or older, drivers, the installation is never complete. their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem (though they have tried).i will not spend money on another dlink product
0	TomTom needs to find a new day job. I hate this unit with a passion and I sell the things. Its cheap, 299.99 at most retail place right now and that's what you are getting. The One died in 24 hours, while plugged in and never turned back on. It also directed us to a road that was headed into the Pacific Ocean, there is no road across in the pacific last time I checked. It acquired Satelites ONCE and then never acquired them again. And good luck talking to customer service, both I talked to didn't speak english...A dreadful unit, maybe TomTom could go work at Walmar
0	WGX102 Prone to Hardware Failure. I purchased a WGX102 about 18 months ago. The first unit I purchased failed after a few months. NetGear replaced it, because it was under warranty. The replacement unit worked nicely for about 15 months, then it failed too, with pretty much the same symptoms. The unit only has a one year warranty, so NetGear told me I would have to buy another. I'm not going to do that, because the units don't seem to last, and I don't want to have to buy another one every 18 months or so.I've seen a number of reviews on various sites by other customers who have had the same experience. Be warned
0	Audio Quality is a Disappointment. I've been using Sony's ECM-MS907 for more than 5 years now and have loved it; so two weeks ago I ordered the Sony ECM-CS10 to use for audio journal keeping while on the road.  When it arrived just a few days ago, I compared the audio quality of its recordings to that of my existing Sony microphone.  In spite of its pleasing aesthetics, I found it to be a sad disappointment!!!  The ECM-CS10 is a very noisy microphone with an audio quality far inferior of what I would expect from a Sony mic.  (I wonder whether this is because it is a plug-in-power mic).Frankly, I think I'm probably going to return it and look for something else.  I've purchased a number of microphones on eBay and have only been satisfied with one other type of compact mic.  Microsound makes it; and its a mic with a cable lead about three inches long.  I'm not in any way affiliated with them, but I would recommend their product.With all of this said, I think I still might spring for Sony's top-of-the-line lapel microphone, just to see whether it's any good
0	Far too uncomfortable. I'm a gamer.  I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical.  Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice.  I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons.  I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play.  It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably.Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.  However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless.
0	Extremely poor choice. Connecting the server was easy. Installation of the utility software no sweat, too. Although, when it came to setup, the server control panel repeatedly asked for a password. Since I didn't set one, it must have been set by factory. Calling the Tech Support did not resolve the matter. Returning to the seller
0	No quality, just speed. While this scanner is quite fast at running documents through, I found that it could not come close to getting any of them properly aligned. I spent more time de-skewing scans than it would have taken to do it on a flatbed scanner. It is plenty good for having 'good enough' images for record keeping, but useless if you are trying to keep higher quality digital records of paper documents
0	Cheap Price, Cheap Quality. This Elgin remake of the original Timex 3400T is nothing like the original.    (I like the original so much I was hoping to buy another.)  Sadly, the quality of this clock is very, very poor.  This new design of the 3400T is completely different (worse) -- they should have changed the part number.I liked the ability to quickly and quietly set a "nap" time in the original.  No more!  The updated version is much more difficult to set and it beeps loudly every time you press a button.I am very disappointed.  I'd gladly pay three times the price to get a 3400T of the original Timex design
0	Runs hot, short life. I installed this power supply as a replacement from Gateway. From the moment I installed it, it did not cool sufficiently. Within a year it had failed completely
0	Unable to install, despite reaching D-Link technical support. From looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff, it appears that there are countless versions of this card, each with different driver software. The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal "automatic" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2.So I called back again. And again. And again.Despite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person.Install from CD. Reboot. etc.It would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they're doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort.I spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card!I am not alone in this experience; see cnet's web site user reviews of the DWL-G650.Another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news.I give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless.Back it goes
0	Only slightly better than aluminum foil... I had aluminum foil attached via coaxial cable to my T.V. before I purchased this antenna.  After hooking the antenna up, I noticed only marginal improvements.  Also, if you want to change between lesser reception channels, you have to completely reposition the antenna.  I would return it, but I would get barely half of what I paid for it, since I would still have to pay for return shipping as well as the original shipping cost
0	Shipping and handling. You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store
0	Targus Port Replicator Glorified USB Hub. This item was ordered as a christmas present and arrived without incident.  It also arrived in a plastic bag with out any software or even a label saying what it was.  After installing this item and beginning use with it, it became evident that the video portion of the device didn't work correctly.  The monitor hooked up displayed the same thing as my laptop but on a 5 second delay and the mouse and everything else appears to trail.  We updated all necessary drivers and sought technical support from Targus.  It took them a long time to respond and once they did, there advice was to hook the monitor directly up to the laptop, defeating the purpose of having a docking station.  So, with that said, if you are looking for a USB hub, this will work, but if you are looking for a Docking Station with Video (as this device/company claim) I would strongly recommend you purchase something from a company other than Targus.
0	A Waste Of Money!. This is without fail the most difficult to use software I have ever seen. I have way better luck using MS Publisher and even Word for making tray liners. I found this product to be a time consuming waste of money. The more time you invest in loearning this software the more you lose. Who wrote this program anyway? Fire them
0	The worst DVDs I have tried so far. I have used three other brands of 16x DVD-Rs and none of them have been problematic with my new (Tivo) dvd burner. This is the first brand that just hasn't worked. These discs were a waste of time shopping for, they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns, and they were a waste of money. I am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the Amazon marketplace since it wouldn't be fair to other buyers. For your information, I have had no problem with Sony, Fuji, and Verbatim
0	Maybe OK for a Smaller Room. I found this unit to be unacceptable for my (large) living room. It failed at about 20 feet or so and I had to return it. Panasonic claims 33 feet range
0	Please don't Buy a Zune. I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006. I used it on a daily basis and was happy with it. Early in April, it stopped working. After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product. I did not abuse it in any way. Please think twice before buying this product. If and when it breaks - Microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a $300.00 paperweight.
0	Good print quality lousy ink usage. Recently I bought an Epson R260, to replace my Epson R200, big mistake, after only 20 or so prints 4/6, the printer ran out of ink, I mean all six cartridges were almost empty, black was totally out, first I thought, well maybe the cartridges, that came with the original packaging were not totally full, I went out and got me a new set of six cartridges, 100+ dolars. After 26 prints, again out of ink. I used to get about 175 / 200 with the old R200. It is ridiculous, you actually see the ink level go down as you print.Excelent print quality lousy ink usage.Did I mention that I was using the lowest possible setting for the quality of prints.When I contacted Epson, the answer was, GET THE CONTINUOS FLOW INK SYSTEM.Nice answer
0	Where has quality gone?. Works fine, looks and feels "cheap."  Very few cordless phones with speaker on handset that are wall mountable?  Why?
0	A niche product that falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, I found the Nexus to be a very niche product. I'm sure anyone who is researching this product knows by now that it does not allow you to listen to live XM content on the go. Fair enough, since it never claimed to. However, the idea of this being such a small player only for use of MP3 content and recorded XM content did not impress me.The screen is incredibly small. Of course, this isn't a problem if you are using this player hand held, or in a situation where you don't want to see the display anyway. However, listening to live XM content is entirely different. Don't expect to have this receiver docked in the home kit a yard away from you, and still have the ability to read the screen.This also becomes a problem in the car. I drive a small compact two-door car, and had the receiver mounted at eye level on the dash. I could see the display okay. Not perfect, but okay. My passengers, however, could not see the display at all. Before you have the chance to think of any bad eyesight jokes, I have had both an XM Roady 2 receiver and a Sirius Audiovox PNP3 receiver mounted in this same position, and never got any complaints. Adjusting the brightness and contrast didn't do much good. The artist text is easier to see than the title text, as it is in bold letters. Having a black and white screen did not help.To record live XM content, you must begin the recording within 45 seconds of the start in order to get the entire selection. This may be great when you hear the first notes of a song you know, love, and want to record, but it's a huge flaw for discovering new music. How many of us can decide within the first 45 seconds of a song whether it is or isn't a song we'll want to hear again? Since XM boasts of having the largest play lists on Satellite Radio, how can you assume that song you just heard on Deep Tracks will be a song you will ever hear again on XM?Wait, you could've just add it to your TuneSelect, so it will notify you next time it is played and you can record it then, right? Nope. The Nexus does not include a TuneSelect. Nor does it even include a memory option, where you can store the artist and song title. There is an option titled "Bookmark" though, where the Nexus and the included Napster software will make it easier for you to find and purchase any song you "Bookmark" when you have the Nexus connected to your PC. However, I could find no way to see what songs I bookmarked without using the included Napster software.The User Interface on the Nexus could use a lot of help. There are way too many buttons to press to find your way around the unit. Simply going from Live XM to Recorded/MP3 content can take a while. Be prepared to wander around aimlessly with this receiver for at least the first few hours.Of course, this receiver does not have the 1-10 presets that other satellite radio receivers do. I did find switching between stations more challenging while driving due to this. You can set up a "favorites" category list on the Nexus, but I would have liked more options for customization with this category.Both the Nexus Home Kit (included with the receiver) and the Car Kit come with remotes. I found the remotes to be pointless though. The remotes could have offered an easier way of getting to your favorite channels, but there was no such option. The number keys on the remote only guided you in accessing a channel if you knew the channel number. If you could dock your Nexus across the room and see the display clear enough, the remotes may have been of more use.As for MP3s, you are able to search by artist or song title, but not album. You just transfered the entire Led Zeppelin II album onto your Nexus, and you want to play it from start to finish? Well, if you have some other Led Zeppelin songs on your Nexus, you'll have to find "Whole Lotta Love" and begin playing there. The album title will not be displayed on the Nexus screen though, and the track number won't be either. I'm not expecting the Nexus to be an iPod, but I did find this to be an extreme annoyance.Note that the Nexus can be partitioned to store either 50% XM content and 50% Personal content, or 100% XM content. Don't expect to fill 1GB of your own MP3 collection.The Nexus also contains a new technology for XM known as the Passport. The passport is a small chip that is docked directly behind the Nexus in the home or car kit. It is not and cannot be physically connected to the Nexus. The passport is only required for Live XM content. If you purchase a Nexus and activate it with XM, you are not actually activating the Nexus. You are activating the XM passport. Essentially, you can purchase as many Passport enabled receivers as you desire and only pay one subscription fee, assuming you will only want to listen to live XM content on one receiver at a time. Of course, this is a plus side to the Passport technology. If you only have the desire to own one Nexus, it can be a real pain to have to carry around and dock both the Nexus and the Passport with you every time you go from the car to home. The Passport's small size could make it much easier to be lost or misplaced as well.I have heard that satellite radio companies make it hard for thieves to get away with stealing equipment. The victim of the theft just needs to contact the company, and they will blacklist the ID of the receiver so it cannot be reactivated. The Passport makes the Nexus an easier target, since it is impossible for the receiver to be blacklisted, due to the ID coming from the Passport.Although I am well aware that the car kit is sold separately, I feel the need to mention in this review that I was not comfortable with the cosmetics of the car dock. The bright silver color of it made it very easy to see, regardless of the time of the day or the amount of light coming into my car. Needless to say, I was concerned that this would be a huge theft magnet. Most satellite radio receivers and mp3 player car docks are much more low profile, and for good reason.Although I'm sure this is the result of stricter FCC guidelines, FM Modulation is only an option with the car kit. Unlike previous satellite radio receivers I have owned, you can use any FM frequency you desire with the Nexus. One thing to note is that the FM Modulation will not work if you have anything plugged into the "Line Out" of the car kit, such as a cassette adapter or axillary cables. I was very disappointed that no FM Modulator is included with the home kit.I can't say there is nothing positive about the Nexus though...Loading your personal music collection onto the Nexus is very simple. You can even simply do a copy/paste or drag and drop though Windows. I used Rhapsody instead of Napster to load some of my songs onto the Nexus, and it worked perfectly.I also liked that there was an equalizer included. Of course this is an expected feature of an MP3 player, but it also works with live XM content.It doesn't play only MP3s either. I have all of my music library encoded with iTunes AAC, with a VBR of 128Kbps. I had no problems with playback of these files.Overall, the Nexus does what it is advertised to do. I feel the receiver comes short on many features and with it's portability though. I noticed the price of these have already gone down substantially since the holidays, and some retailers have already stopped carrying them. It should be interesting to see if Samsung and XM continuing with this design. Hopefully they will address some issues and create a receiver worth while.
0	Cheap made phone. It works and plays well but not made great. Some buttons you have to press twice to make it work. Call Id works fine
0	Poor sound quality destroys a good idea. I bought the wireless base with 5 handsets to replace a VTEC 2.4GHz  setup that was being stepped on by my wireless network.  Quite frankly, I regret it.  Sound quality on the Motorola units is extremely poor...sometimes.  And it is not predictable.  I have tried moving the base unit and even sitting next to the base unit when the sound quality is poor and there is little correlation to distance from the base.  The range is vastly inferior to the VTEC 2.4 GHz units.  I can talk on the VTECHs up to 400 ft away from the base and I can't even use the Motorolas in the next room.  It's too bad because Motorola did a good job with the features and functions.  I especially like the blinking light on each hand unit to notify of a waiting message.  The ability to have a local and global phone book is also a very good feature.  Despite the good choice of features, what good is a phone that breaks up and clicks while in use?  Don't buy these unit
0	what's the point of 96 sleeves? I CAN'T CLOSE THE CASE!!. I got in on this deal for a great price, but when i put 90 cd's in, I couldn't even come close to closing the case, now I have to transfer them all back to the other case!!!
0	Useless piece of trash. This mouse is designed horribly bad !! It opens fine when it is new, but as soon as you put in the batteries, it refuses to open. I suspect that the designers of this mouse did not think about trying to open it when the batteries are in .. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you want a use and throw mouse.I thought Kensington was a good company. Did not expect this from them. I will stay away from their products henceforth
0	Bad Choice. One star is being generous. I bought this router to replace my worn out (5 year old) Linksys router. Seemed like a good deal (cheap). The TRENDnet router was deemed defective after spending two hours on the phone with an (outsourced) TRENDnet tech who seemed to have less of an idea than I did on how to get it going. DON'T BUY ONE. I went to the local electronics store and bought another Linksys. It set-up perfectly the first try minutes after I got it home
0	Too complicated/small for us. We ordered this case/auto mount for our Philips PET710 7" Widescreen Portable DVD Player because it was the one recommended by Amazon.  I needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler.  I eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift), but it has a number of drawbacks.-In order to mount it, you have to remove the top half(huh?).  Having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose.  I accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when I drove away.-It's too small.  The Philips portable DVD player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case.  Plus (and this is really amazing), it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the DVD player.  I have to carry the headphones and sleaved DVDs seperately!I chose my last DVD player b/c it came with an auto mount case, and even though I like the Philips DVD player, I'd do that again if I had it to do over.  Having the right case/mount for your DVD player is that key
0	dont store valuables on this. Both of my  LaCie Big Disk Extremes have been returned to manufacturer within a year of purchase due to power issues. In each case I have lost time and valuable data (they reformat the drive after repair as stardard operating procedure). Lacie makes decent drives so this surprised me. Later models may have fixed the problem, but the LaCie Big Disk Extreme has issues.
0	More trouble than it's worth. This is a gadget with more promise than delivery. It was a retirement gift to me and I'm sure glad that not a penny from my pocket went toward the purchase. Difficult to operate and the end product is not worth the trouble. You have been warned
0	will not work. I purchased one that never worked.  I had it replaced and it still didn't work.  I followed directions explicitly, and tried 3 different locations on the fm band that had no signal present.  Not a sound.  Didn't matter which volume control was turned up or if they were both up.  Nothing.  Therefore, I have no idea about performance
0	Junk. After reading the reviews, I realized there were varied results from those who had purchased the Adesso Cyber-tablet 6400. Since my daughter was going to use the pen and tablet in MS Paint, I thought it should work fine. Was I wrong! The wireless mouse was irratic and the the pen worked about 50% of the time. When the pen did work, it responded well after her mation started. Our computer is an average P-III Dell with plenty of memory. For the price, I expeced more.Adesso, find a another line of work!Shopper, buy another product.
0	Terrible Reception. Forget using the antenna for air reception.....its almost useless.  Lots of video noise and no sound on weak channels (no fine tuning possible).  The only saving factor of this item is its cable connection....works fine.  But if you have cable connection available, why hook it up to this small screen player?
0	Don't buy the Audiovox D1750T, it WILL break!. Hello, this is my first Amazon review, actually my first anywhere review.  I normally depend on reading reviews but was never so affected by a product, positive or negative, that I felt a need to write a review.  My experience with Audiovox's D1750T DVD player has changed that.I'll put it as plainly as this:  If you buy this product, it WILL break.  That is a fact.That says it all, and the rest may get long winded, but read on if you want to know how/why it will break.  I purchased this product 6 months ago.  After 2 months the hinge on the battery that allows you to set the unit on a tabletop and watch hands-free broke.  I thought it was a fluke but was able to get a replacement.  Now my second battery has broken in the exact same place, the exact same way, and that's after the fact that I did my best to handle the unit with the utmost care, since I thought it might have been my fault the first time.It is now clear to me that this is a manufacturing error, one in fact that Audiovox's Customer Service representative acknowledged yet refused to do anything about since I was outside the 90 days warranty.  Unfortunately I've only found one other person online who's written about it (epinions.com) but that's out of maybe 6 total reviews I've found anywhere online.The player gets 2 stars from me because battery issues aside, it's a decent player at a decent price.  The resolution and sound without headphones leave something to be desired, but if you can pick it up for $200 or less it would be a good player as far as screen size and general quality goes.  But this battery issue and subsequent customer service issue is unacceptable.  People need to be warned when they're buying something that is flawed in its manufacturing and will break.Another warning is that the paint(?) or whatever it is that makes the sides of the unit black has started to flake so now the unit's good looking design is marred.... insult to injury I tell ya!  Bottom line, I say don't buy it, but if you'll be using it in such a way that you won't use the battery's stand (btw, there's a stand that flips off the back if you're using the unit with external power.  I've never had a use for it.), then I guess it's a decent player.  I'll bet there's better ones out there for the money though.P.S. I finally managed to strongarm a higher-up at Audiovox into replacing the battery for free.... this time.  Fingers crossed THIS one doesn't break too...
0	Annoying and Frustrating...Not What I expected from HP. I started my own business and purchased this item because of my past experiences with HP laser jets.  One year later, I'm about to throw it out the window and buy a new printer.Why?  First of all, even when printing in black and white, the device uses color ink.  Approximately 97% of my printing is black and white, yet the color ink cartridge levels are consistently depleted.  As a result, I have to purchase (what a surprise) HP color inks even though I don't ever use them.  I estimate that's cost me about $150-200 over the last year.The second reason I despise this machine relates to its annoying warning message pop-up boxes.  When ink is running low in any cartridge, a pop-up appears.  They cannot be disabled.  They appear until the ink cartridge is completely empty.  Since the machine depletes color inks at such minute levels, these messages can appear for days (or until you replace it with another expensive HP ink cartridge).Lastly, the machine will not operate if any of the ink cartridges are empty.  I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to print a simple black and white document but could not because the machine was out of pink or yellow ink.Clearly HP has decided that the best way to make money is through ink sales.  If they'd focused more on the customer's ultimate experience, they'd have secured me as a repeat, long-term customer

0	Card slot cover broke 1st day....... The cover to the slot for the card broke the 1st day, very weak hinges and door is in an area that is most likely to get grabbed when using it.
0	My roommate's broke, then mine broke!. My roommate's mouse broke (she had the older L shaped receiver)... and I thought it was because she's bad with technology. But I'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment... and even mine broke (a few months later, I had a straight receiver). It just gave up on me. Not a battery issue. More like a connection issue.Now I read all these reviews about it breaking on people. Well, I'll write back when my other roommate's break, and when my cousin's break.Don't get me wrong... but it was great while it lasted. Less than half a year. Gonna go back to my Logitech. That never broke on me
0	Positively HORRIBLE; don't waste your funds. To say that I've wanted to throw this *smartdeck* out of my car window countless times may be a strong indication of how poorly it works.Never have I encountered a product that works so poorly. Don't even CONSIDER owning this accessory if you live in an area of the country that dips below 60 degrees; it seems the product works even worse in the cold!Upon pluggin my iPod into the smartdeck, the adapter makes my iPod jump, from song to song, playing the first 1/2 a second of each. It's rare that I'm able to get the adapter to play the iPod normally.I will no doubt be shopping around the competition for a stronger, more reliable piece of equipment for my iPod
0	not worth the trouble or money!!!. This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating
0	Too quirky. After purchasing these earbuds for a bargain price a few days ago, I was ecstatic with the initial quality I heard from the tracks I was playing on my Zen, but for all the package's hype (including a tag proclaiming some kind of award the earbuds had won in 2004) the Philips Surround Sound Earbuds aren't all they're cracked up to be.  After the somewhat promising initial tests, it took me only a couple more uses to realize that the EQ and frequency response on these puppies was way out of whack to say the least.  The product specs on the package claimed the earbuds to have a maximum frequency pick-up of 22kHz, which is interesting considering the human ear can only hear to just below that level.  So, theoretically these earbuds can deliver any and all sound the media dishes out, right?Not only did I notice significant attenuation on the higher frequencies when the volume of my Zen was turned up barely past the halfway mark, but also a complete domineering of the low-end sounds in whatever media happened to be playing.  Just try playing some ambient music with these things to get an idea of the frustration I felt trying to enjoy some relaxing vibes amidst all the jarring distortion and ringing I was hearing.  There doesn't seem to be a feasible solution to this, either, as the earbuds seemed completely oblivious to my efforts of adjusting the EQ output on my player.  Additionally, the assymetrical cord design seems a bit of a silly concept considering the undue amount of pull and tug it places on the left earbud, causing it to fall out a little too easily.  Ranting aside, though, those of you seeking out something better than the stock earbuds your portable music player has provided you with should probably keep searching
0	Won't work with Philips Jackrabbit CD-Rewriter. I tried using these CD's with the Philips Jackrabbit CD-Rewriter and they don't work
0	Scratched my Macbook. As long as its on, it will prevent scratches, but its tough to get off, and that act can scratch your laptop.  It scratched my Macbook when I pried it off.  The guy at the Apple Store who snapped it on a Macbook beause I requested a "demo", couldn't pry it off, and after 10 embarassing minutes, he called a colleague over, and they pried it off together.  And, to be honest, this makes the MB look ugly - kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel.  ;--
0	P.I.T.A to get working, Poor Tech Support. It took me 3+ days to get this thing to work with my notebook.  Cannot get it to work with my desktop.  Tech support was no help at all.  They just had me retrying things I already did.  If your not a networking wizard do not buy this router.  Newer models don't need the manual setup of this one
0	When It Works, It's the Best Available Tape Adapter.  But... I've read many of the reviews of the sorely disappointed, and I understand their complaints since I've also experienced many of the same problems.  There are, however, some workarounds that might help some of the stuckees...Regarding too-high-gain leading to static, I've learned through trial and error that the not-so-SmartDeck volume is fairly random due to variations in mechanical position of its head relative to the tape deck head.  If  the volume is set too high (or low), try plugging the SmartDeck in and out a few times, or reach your finger in and see if you can jiggle its position.  Picking an especially loud song while you do this will help you to know when you have successfully adjusted to a good volume.  Unfortunately, this workaround doesn't work for all iPods... although I can always successfully find a good position with my 4th generation 40GB iPod, I've noticed that the output from the iPod mini is significantly louder, and therefore, much harder to adjust this way.Regarding the tapedeck-spits-out-SmartDeck problem, I've noticed that I only get this problem when the SmartDeck is cold, usually first thing in the morning (clearly, this is the tape deck thinking the SmartDeck is a jammed tape).  Try warming the SmartDeck by blowing warm breath into the hole where the fake "tape" is, then put it back in.  In cold weather, the deck itself is also going to be cold, so you may have to do this several times until the entire car warms up.  It seems to me that this problem has become less pronounced over time -- I rarely have to do this more than once nowadays.Unfortunately, I don't have a workaround for the intermittent track-skip/FF problem.  I have seen that once or twice, though in general, that feature tends to work for me (both track skip, and track FF/Rewind).  I have a suspicion that this is another cold weather problem and a side effect of the spits-out-tape problem, but now that I have a workaround for the latter problem, I've not seen this problem in over a year.Ironically, if you manage to avoid all these warts, the SmartDeck is the best-sounding adapter I've ever heard.  Plus, the auto-on/off feature is much more valuable than you might think (and no one seems to complain that this feature is broken). With the four other adapters I've tried -- two cassette, and two FM transmitter -- I cannot tell you how many times I forgot to turn my iPod off when I exited the car, then came back to a dead iPod.  Nevertheless, the warts are pretty obnoxious, therefore I must deduct 3 stars from this otherwise 5-star product
0	Sony CD400 CDP-CX400. Had this model above for 5 years. Started skipping during playing any CD ..not scratched. My CX300 model is 8 years old, and works great. When you check the sony site for service, if not under warranty, it's about 195 bucks for an exchange, and 122 for service.I sure would like to know what's the problem with these? Don't exchange! Buy a new one for about 220, and smash the old one....make sure you video it and post on YouTube
0	Panasonic CD player is not continuous. The Panasonic CD player has a good sound quality, but does not automatically change from one CD to the next. It requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one CD to another. This feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications, and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five CD's
0	What a waste... First off, the ipod jiggles no matter what you do, secondly, it doesn't stay straight on the power plug, it constantly tilts(the whole thing)...not worth $10
0	Performance is good but lacks accesories. I purchased the Creative nano 1GB at Christmas and was impressed with performance and accesories that were included for the price. I then purchased the muvo v100 which is almost identical to the nano but a little larger and has a direct USB plug-in. For essentially the same price, I did not get any accesories(a armband,skin, or belt clip) I had to purchase an armband from Creative for about what the player cost, because was not availiable anywhere else. Creative also charged my card wrong for the armband. So use caution when dealing with this
0	Terrible Product. I had to continue to send back this product because it wouldn't work. I ended up going through 4 before I gave up entirely. This product is NOT reliable and I didn't even want to give it 1 star
0	Not Vista Compatible. I was disappointed to learn this card won't work with Windows Vista.  I bought the router + card together in hopes of getting broader coverage even though it isn't fully standards-compliant ("Pre-N").  I contacted support about the issue and they sent me instructions that didn't work out.  Might be a good product for WindowsXP, but for my purposes I rate it 1 star
0	Destroyed my CD--I wanna give this product  minus 5 stars. Before the repair process there was one bad track on my CD.  After the "repair" process the entire disk was unplayable.  Took it back for a refund. With billions of CDs in the world, is this the best that the 21st century has to offer?
0	Don't buy this loser. For $99 this should be a much better remote.  If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least.  Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote.  You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly.  If you have to go into the device menu  a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume.  Why not have an option to program each button period...  But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life.  Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month.  Ridiculous.  Only remote I have ever had like this
0	Junk. This product is aweful.  The gear strips, the pad is staionary while the disk spins and this leads to circular scratches on the disk. Compared to the Disk Washer product that I had used for 15 years, this product is junk.AVOID IT
0	Stops working after 3 months. This DVD player does play all types of DVDs no matter how you burn it.  But like other reviews, it stopped working after 3-6 months.  In my case, it was 3 months.  It just doesn't turn on anymore.  I unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead.  I don't watch DVDs much, so it's not like I overused it. Go with another model.  This one has problems.  I thought mines would be the exception, but I guess not.  And now I can't return it because it's been over 30 days.
0	Unfortunately Doesn't Last. I bought a 700 series iRiver to use at the gym, which came with this Armband, at first it was great, but it didn't last, there are two clasps which don't sta attcked well, and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use
0	Not glow in the dark  keys. In february 28 I purchased this remote control,mainly for his feature that the keys glows in the dark.Well thats not true!In the add for this product clearly says that, even in the Sony"sWeb page also appear that information.I read 3 times the manual instruction booklet and...nothing about it.!What is this? It isa lie? or a last time chages in the specifications? I am verydissapointing
0	Decent, but not as advertised on Amazon.com. Pros:  solid construction, good feel, excellent sound quality, works with power outCons:  keypad isn't backlit, caller ID isn't backlit (contradicts advertising as of 9/19/2004!), if on table then caller ID visible only when looking down at phoneNeutral:  caller ID and programmable buttons (3 of them) dependent on 3 AA batteriesI've been on a quest for the perfect corded phone.  I wanted something with a cord so that there's at least one working phone in the event of a power outage, and I wanted caller ID since I enjoy knowing who I'm going to be stuck talking to when I pick up the phone.  One of my requirements for caller ID is that it have a backlit display so I wouldn't have to turn on the light in the middle of the night if I got a call.  I tried the AT&T 210 trimline paired up with the GE 29096 caller ID box, but that didn't work well since the box wasn't backlit and it kept clicking on the line as if it were trying to flash it.So you can imagine my delight after having read the specs on the AT&T 240 corded phone.  According to the information on Amazon.com, it had the trimline profile that I like, a heavier weight to the handset so it doesn't feel flimsy, and a backlit caller ID unit built into the back of the handset.  Plus, it was inexpensive.  I bought one immediately.  When I unboxed it, I was happy with the weight and design of the phone, even though it doesn't have a backlit keypad like the trimline phones of old do, like the AT&T 210 that I was using.  A pity, since that's a nice feature and one for which I would have been glad to pay more.So anyway, I hooked it up and tested it out.  The phone had a good feel to it, comfortable to hold as well as cradle between ear and shoulder.  The quality of the sound was excellent, both clear and without the tinny sound that can result from the audio compression in cordless phones.  I only had one complaint, but it was a major one:  the caller ID wasn't backlit.  Moreover, there was nothing in the instruction manual indicating that it was supposed to be, either.  This was a big gripe since the real feature of this phone for me was the backlit caller ID that Amazon.com advertises.A possible problem for others considering the 240 as a telephone would be the orientation of the caller ID window.  As it's on the top of the handset, you have to be looking down at the phone if you decide to rest it on a table or nightstand, i.e., there is no accessory to clip on the back to give it an angled elevation nor, due to the location and style of the rubber feet, can an impromptu one be constructed.  This essentially means that if you rest the phone on a table then the caller ID window is viewable only if you stand up, lean over, or pick up the entire phone along with the base and look at it.  Of course, if you don't care who's calling then you can pick up the phone and just take your chances; to me, however, this defeats my main reason for caller ID -- not having to talk to people I don't want to.  If you just use it as a phonebook of recent callers, then this isn't a problem.  Also, if you wall mount the telephone then this isn't an issue at all.  I use this telephone in my bedroom but have it wall-mounted next to the bed so I can see the caller ID just fine...in the light, that is.So, in conclusion, the AT&T 240 is a corded phone with great sound quality and a good feel to it.  I wish that the keypad were backlit and I'm quite unhappy that the caller ID window isn't backlit.  This is a good corded phone that, with a longer cord, could be a great wall-mounted kitchen phone.  I would not recommend it for a location where the lights may be out or the area could be dimly lit.  I am presently using it for a bedroom phone, but if I find another corded phone in a trimline model that has a real backlit caller ID then I will probably switch and move this phone to the kitchen or in a spare drawer for storage.
0	sucks!. Bought new around $80.  CD player and LCD CLOCK stopped working within 6 months--now nap function and radio are all that works--if only I could find the damn receipt!!!
0	Linksys CIT310 Dual-Mode Cordless Phone for Yahoo! Messenger. This product didn't work like it said it would. I think it Sucks!!!Maybe it will work better in the USA. I'm currently in Iraq. Yahoo! Messenger with voice online works Great for me. I thought buying the phone would work good too, but I was wrong!If your deployed, don't waste your money! Use Yahoo! Messenger with voice but make sure you have a web cam build in your laptop or PC.I would have gave the phone no Stars but it would not let me!
0	I should have believed the other reviewers... Even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers I still purchased it.  It is pretty easy to set up, but once connected to my PC it had very inconsistent behavior.The device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for 1-2 hours and require a reset.The video performance was awful with the included software.  Tversity freeware media server made video performance better, but fast forward and rewind wouldn't work do to some video conversion routines being run by Tversity.Music files would play, and sounded good, but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature doesn't work.  Really...  Doesn't work at all.I upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work.  Finally I gave up and shipped it back to Amazon.  The thing was just more trouble than it was worth.FYI:  Amazon returns were great.
0	WARNING: Why o' why do aliens n' non-humans try to cheat us?. SELLER'S: For an honest review go to the CORRECT page for the Bose 321 Graphite w/ Accoustimass 3rd module and two satellite speakers.  That will have the correct retail rate and draw the true end-buyers/purchasers.  This price of $700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here.  I hope this helped you in your endeavors and I look forward to honestly/fairly competing with you in the future!BUYER'S: Buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or "mistakes" on the sellers' part in contractual agreements to Amazon customer service.  Because if this ad by that company/seller is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system (2 satellite and 1 lrg Acoustimass) you are in for a steal! literally, so get a goin! LolDisclaimer: this review is an anti-review posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description (which is it?? 2 speakers or 3???) in this advertisement for above mentioned product.  Why isn't BOSE listed as a seller?! DOH  No slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true
0	good product - fatal software upgrade - very, very poor "service". Initially my Tomtom One was excellent. Then I made the fatal mistake of allowing Tomtom Home to automatically upgrade the software. The device never worked again because it could no longer find any satellites! (My computer has the maximum security offered by Windows XP and Norton Internet Security so it seems unlikely that the process was contaminated in any way.)On 11 Feb - I contacted Customer Service - nice courteous responses but no solution. Finally, on their advice, I returned it to the retailer on 27 Feb. It finally arrived at Tomtom Service on 8th March. That was the last I have heard of it!!!I rang Tomtom Customer service on 2nd April and they could not trace the unit. Over the following 2.5 weeks I tried a series of faxes and online service queries but have received absolutely no human intervention or assistance.In summary - I bought a "good" product, the online software stuffed it up and, over the following two months, Tomtom service achieved nothing except for apparently loosing my Tomtom!!!Postscript:  Finally, almost two months after seeking replacement of the faulty item, I have been advised that it is to be replaced. No apology or expression of regret from Tomtom but at least I will have a GPS.Even though I vowed never to tangle with Tomtom Customer "Service" again, and I am free to choose the replacement model and manufacturer, I have found that Tomtom One still offers the best performance/price balance for my purposes.I just hope that my new Tomtom runs well so that I will not have to be "serviced" again by Tomtom
0	Basic functions OK, put caution on PS/2 ports. I acquired this unit about a week ago to serve as a docking station for a new laptop computer that does not have any of the traditional ports on it.  You must install the software that comes with it to use the serial or parallel ports, and I had to reboot my computer to get the parallel port working.  (Note that the serial port appears on a non-standard setting, mine is COM4, so any software must be directed to that location.)  I have not tried the serial port, but the USB and parallel ports appear to work fine.  However, beware that the PS/2 ports on the unit do not work the same way as built-in PS/2 ports.  A keyboard and mouse plugged into them will perform their basic functions. But, if you have an advanced mouse or keyboard with extra keys or other options, they will not function through the docking station.  It appears that the PS/2 ports on the docking station are wired to always appear to the operating system as some form of generic Human Interface Device mouse and keyboard, rather than recognizing whatever form of keyboard is plugged in -- as happens with built-in PS/2 ports.  Because of that, I could not find a way to get the computer to match the special mouse and keyboard drivers required for the advanced functions to those devices when connected to the docking station.  Kensington support ignored my first two requests for help on this issue, and then suggested I contact the keyboard and mouse vendors -- which does not make any sense because the devices work fine any time except when they are connected through the PS/2 ports on the docking station. I had to find another way to bridge my keyboard and mouse into a USB port to get them to work.  For that reason, I probably would not have purchased this unit if I had known about this issue.  However, if  you only need a parallel and serial port, as well as two USB ports, this unit will work fine.
0	quick shippment, user unfriendly, lost reception from time to time. i don't recommend this produc
0	I did not receive what I bought. I bought a XD to CF adapter, as per the picture on the page. Instead I received, as others did, a PMCIA adapter which is not what I wanted or needed. For the first time, I felt cheated by Amazon and don't know what to do. Hope to receive some explanation
0	SONY = Stops Operating Next Year. This unit looks nice and plays nice, until it doesn't anymore.This piece of crap worked for only 3 months and was turned on about 10x only, as it stood in my bedroom where I only seldom listen to music. It went dead all of a sudden, and Sony doesn't honor the limited warranty !!Apparently, what I have (a short circuit, that prevents me from turning the unit on) is a common defect and it's even MENTIONED in the owner's manual (ie if you get standy flashing, you're in trouble!).I had several bad experiences with Sony, this will be my last. My advice is stay with Panasonics, they're way way way better.
0	Great for women... but what about men?. Prior to my Zen V Plus, I had a Creative MuVo TX FM which came with an armband and belt clip in the box. It was a very comfortable and easy to use until it was stolen. As a replacement, I thought I would upgrade to the Zen. Unfortunately the armband for the Zen V Plus had to be purchased separately; I chose to go with the Creative branded band based on my previous experience. To my surprise, the Creative armband is too small for me. Now, I'm 6'2", but I'm not much of a weight lifter, so my biceps are only 14". However, the available strap length is less than that, so I cannot get a comfortable fit. It fits too tightly and tends to pops open as I try to secure it due to lack of slack.  I looked online and found that the average male bicep is 13" in circumference - about the same as the armband's strap. As previous reviewers have stated, the included silicon skin is nice, but it seems that this unit was designed for women, children, and smaller than average men. So guys, unless you have a 12" bicep or smaller, I would look elsewhere for an armband to use while you work out
0	doesn't work, tech support not good, manual not good. i just received this unit yesterday to serve as a bridge to my Belkin wireless router (the router manual specifies this AP).  Cannot get it to talk wirelessly to the Belkin router. I've spent a good deal of time with it including 30 minutes with Belkin tech support, which consisted of someone reading a script to me, arguing about trivial things, and then ringing off before the issue was resolved. Frustrating to say the least. I'm also not impressed with the lack of logging, as well as the wide-open browser access (your SSID and security settings are displayed to anyone without logging in).The manual is sadly out of date and does not match the firmware nor the physical product, which would make setup difficult for an inexperienced user. Belkin would like to have us believe that this is a plug and play product, but this is not the case.generally, this is pretty much a piece of cr*p. I'm tring to get Belkin to RMA it and either replace it or refund. Overall, I'm more impressed with Linksys/Cisco products than Belkin, even in this price range
0	HP 6310 has awful software. I installed this machine on a home office network via Ethernet.  The install took awhile, and changed registry settings without asking.  Uninstall did NOT restore the system to it's original state; only hours of manual resetting did that.  How many users can restore the registry?Further, the software/drivers do not like the printer turned off or missing.  If you install this on a road laptop, you can expect a program, HPZinw12.exe, to search for the missing printer every 100 seconds or so using all available CPU time.  If you are unlucky enough to be in the middle of a client presentation, the chances are good that you have just lost the job.If you turn off the printer in the office, your office systems will also search for the printer and display an unclosable dialog asking you to switch to an unknown program while using most of their available CPU time. (Please note that 6 hidden dlls are also running at all times.)  This software is totally equivalent to a virus except for duplication.I returned this system and will never buy another HP product
0	mismailed TomTom One Charger. I love the Tom Tom One and very highly recommend it.  However, the extra electrical charger I ordered does not adapt to the Tom tom One.  As I am 3,000 miles away from home the electric charger is a disappointment.  But the Tom Tom One is terriffic.  It makes adjustments to my wrong turns and keeps me on track. I'm thinking seriously of buying a second one for my wife as soon as I get back home
0	They denied the rebate request, what a rip-off!. Your rebate submission has been received.Unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons:REQUEST POSTMARKED AFTER CLOSE OF PROGRAM DEADLINEREQUIRED POSTMARK BEFORE 09/10/04; ACTUAL POSTMARK 09/13/04***********************************************There was absolutely no cut-off submission deadline given, except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase.All were followed to the "T".I submitted the rebate immediately after I received the merchandise from Amazon.Give me a break, I'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10' pole.If it was not so piddling an amount, this would be worth reporting to FCC, but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops, probably for nothing, more heartache.Just forego rebates, send Viking back to the boat and purchase another brand
0	stay away!!!. Terrible! The CD-ROM didn't even have any data on it. I am in the process of returing this junk for a refund
0	Too Bulky. Not for a Sony Vaio. I bought this case for a Sony Vaio SZ140 after seeing a spotlight review saying that the Vaio would fit perfectly inside. I ended up returning the bag for a refund for two reasons:1. My Vaio (13.3" screen) was just slightly too big to fit in the case. The case itself is very well padded with thick foam. I probably could have forced it in, but it would definitely have taken some forcing. I'd guess a Macbook would fit better.2. The case itself is just too bulky. I bought it looking for a sleeve that would protect my notebook while carrying it in a backpack or messenger bag. This case is very large for a sleeve and would barely fit in my bags. True, it comes with a shoulder strap, but if you're going to use that you might as well go with a regular-sized bag so you can carry your power cords and other accessories.This case seems to have trouble making up its mind whether it's a sleeve or a regular notebook bag, doing a poor job at either. It's too big for a sleeve and too small for a bag
0	Didn't work out of the box. Connected the TV which would stay on for a max of 5 min then would turn itself off. I called Samsung to schedule service and it took them a week to come out and see the TV. I still don't have the TV back... Once it works, I might review this differently but extremely disappointed
0	Didn't work for me..... I spent hours trying to get this to work, and I am pretty good with computers. Spent hours on the phone with linksys and finally got someone who said if my wireless router isnt Linksys it probably wont work. I bought this to use with my multifunction printer, will return
0	Price is right, but that's all. I thought because these are "gumy" headphones they would be comfortable but they are not.  They hurt my ears as much as any other.  If ear pain is your problem when you wear ear-buds, then don't get these.
0	Poor reception. I bought this at CompUSA.  I live in rural Vermont.  The AutoSearch works fairly well.  The static when connected is acceptable. A big problem is that suddenly you'll get blasted by static when the FM signal is interfered with.   I'm bringing it back for refund. I agree with the previous reviewer - it's NOT worth it. My wife's old 8 station Monster works much better.I'm going to try going back to my old Belkin charge which connects to a cassette
0	iConcepts Hotsync Charger. Not impressed. Charged fine but the adapter to my iPAQ was not secure at all. Any slight motion of the cable and the pda lost connection to my computer. So, unless you plan on not bumping your cable or ipaq EVER while syncing, i'd steer away from this. Also ran into power issues with the iConcepts cradle
0	garbage. I bought this card because I had heard it works well with linux. Well I didn't get that far with card because when it arrived it was DOA and doesn't work at all. So now I have to either pay shipping to send it back to amazon or contact dlink and try to get them to send me a replacement :
0	don't waste your money. This is by far the worst detector I have ever had.Does not detect even close signals.  Had it in for repair twice, still does not work properly.Gives great false signals and makes a fine [although expensive]door stop
0	Not powerful enough. I needed an antenna that provided a power boost to amplify the signal.  I bought this antenna based on the review of others.  If I had realized it didn't amplify the signal, I would have looked elsewhere.  Oh well, my bad!  I live 20-25 miles from the signal I'm trying to capture, and this antenna didn't do it for me.
0	Unreliable.  Cute Design.  Bad Engineering.  Poor Quality Control. My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the "Genius" bar. At that appointment, the "genius" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple "genius" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.Perhaps it should be retitled the "idiot bar.
0	Dont' buy this junk. I purchased my 500 in September, it's now January and it has never worked correctly at all. It would say that I am in Russia, then lock up (I live in NJ USA). The first time that I sent it it, my expense, Magellan support sent it back to me within 24 hours; and it was not fixed. It still said that I was in Russia and would lock up. The second time that I sent it to them, they sent me a shipping label via email. They had it in their paws for about 2 weeks. It came back said that I was in Peru and then lock up. I have an old Lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal, it always locked on to my location (albeit a little slow), and it worked.I've been trying to get a new shipping label for this piece of junck now for one month. First they said that they sent it to me via email, but they said that because I have anti-spyware sw on my pc that my Outlook is rejecting the label. But, I use web based email. Then they said that they will send a label to me via regular mail. It's been two and a half weeks and I have not yet received that label. They told me that they sent it out 3 days before Christmas and that I didn't receive the label because of the delays in mail due to Christmas and New Year's. But it's now January. Who knows, maybe I'll be lucky and receive the label before 2008.It's clear to me that they have no intention of fixing this piece of junk. It was a mistake to buy it; don't you make the same mistake.
0	Works - almost. I am using this thing with a Toshiba laptop, and a Microsoft mouse and keyboard. It installed as advertised and seemed great - until:-Generation of random mouse clicks. Seems to do this in all programs and it is very annoying. Imaging editing in Word and having the cursor jump to the mouse cursor location, or just having random right clicks.-Synchronization and random behavior of the CAP's lock. CAP's lock turns off and on randomly and then will not sychronize with the laptop keyboard. The only remedy I have found is a reboot.Maybe I got a lemon, but based on other review on other sites, I cannot recommend this device
0	Piece of Garbage. Created HW Probs on D-Link router. I attached this antenna to a D-Link DI-624 wireless router to try to expand the range then all of the wired ethernet ports started dropping connectivity and I was getting "hardware error" reports from the network monitor.Took the antenna off and it all worked fine again. You would think D-Link would have at least tested this with their own product
0	Doesnt Play HD only outputs in HD - Good Standard Player. Bought this product to stream HD media from PC/USB Storage. All though advertised on the box and website  it does not play the HD media. I tried to play the media from all 3 available inputs (802.11(wireless), Ethernet, and USB HD) and several formats that are supported (avi,mpeg2,ts,mp4). The HD movies were choppy at best. Plays all other non HD videos without a problem. Divx videos as well(even though it doesn't say it plays them on the box). Worked well with 500GB USB Drive but not needed. Would not recommend because HD feature is useless. Dlink technical support said to take it back to the store. There technical support grade is D- .
0	Poor Item. The only reason I even gave it one star was that it did turn on.  The battery lasts about 1 hour fully charged, which is just sad.  I could not communicate with a vessel that was 1 mile from me, which again is sad.  Spend a little more money and get a better product.
0	Did not work. I plugged this cable into my TV, and the TV did not recognize the source, I'm not sure it the TV needs to be digital.
0	great while it worked - broke after 13 months. Really liked it.   Would have rated it 4-star.But last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turnon anymore. Only the clock works.Just one month out of warranty.From other reviews, this seems to be a common problem
0	AcAdaptor for Cobra. I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says.
0	Bad bad bad. Waste of time and money. If I could give this device a review of less than one star I would. An MP3 player is nothing more than a usb memory stick with a player wrapped around it. It should just work. However I've run into the following while attempting to set it up.1. Unrecognized device. Uninstall USB device and try again...2. Device malfunctioned. Uninstall broken device from device manager and try again.3. Recognized device but says there are two removable disks that are both zero bytes in size.4. Links in tech support page all give 404 errors5. Device driver download from coby, only downloads a font file. No driver.It's too late in the evening to call support, it was a christmas gift for my son from out of state. No reciept, can't return.It might make a good item to throw at the neighbors cats when they get in my yard.Other companies have figured out how to make a portable music player "just work" with my computer, why can't these guys?My time is much more valuable than the time I spent to not get it working
1	Targus PA238U. The stand is a great height.  It is now much easier to use my laptop - no neck strain and shoulder strain from having to sit and type in an uncomfortable position.  The criticism I have is that it is difficult to get to the USB ports in the back of my laptop.  I would also like the top of the stand to be a little more vented for cooling the laptop
1	Better then all the fancy mousepads - buy this. This is a great product at a great price. I bought four twenty dollar  mouse pads before this, all the others really serve no purpse, the gel  packs block my way the harder surfaces dont grab that well and it is  worthless and a horrible waste of money. This mouse pad is the one im  sticking with it grabs well looks good and its under 5 bucks!! This is a  must for anyone. When it all comes down to it, all the fancy stuff serves  no purpose and wastes alot of money. Buy this product
1	Handy Gadget to Prevent Skipping. When my CDs started skipping I thought they has seen the last days of spinning, however this Disc Cleaner has solved all problems. You simply put the CD into the cleaner with the label side down. Then, you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface. You only apply one even spray of cleaner. Then, you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed.Once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times, you can remove the disc and let it dry completely. Most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations. I found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick.The first time I used this cleaner I was a bit frustrated with it because I noticed little pieces of black foam all over my CDs. Apparently, there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down, but once I removed that piece of foam, all was go.This unit comes with one additional cleaning pad. I think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints, you won't have to replace the cleaning pads very often.Handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces.~TheRebeccaReview.com
1	Worth the money!. I bought this to replace the standard wires that come with a PS2.  The wires that come with a PS2 are not worth a buck!  As soon as I changed the wires It was amazing!  The colors are so vivid!Cartoon games have AMAZING COLOR!  THrow your old wires in the trash & Buy Monster for game consoles!  YOu will be glad you did, if you like gaming
1	400 GB External Hard Drive. prety good product no problems fast shipping and fast
1	Great Transmitter/Charger for the money. Bought this charger after reading several other reviews, so far I haven't had to switch preset channels at all, plays clear/static free all around the Portland, OR and metro area. If you have standard size cup holders near your aux/lighter jack this transmitter should fit in nicely. I'm using a Nano with ours and the fit is good. It's great to have an all in one device, that charges as it plays
1	Beautiful picture and fantastic sound. I bought this set for my bedroom. I already own a Samsung 40'. There is no comparison between the two. The Toshiba has a better picture and sound quality. TO me it sounds like a stero. I beleive you won't disappointed with this purchas
1	KB Gear Jam Tablet- it's worth it. I bought this recently not knowing much about what was out on the market in terms of tablets, and I have some advice if you're going to buy this product.Pros: It's a shame Wacom doesn't make tablets that are 5x7 since I have found out that this is the perfect size- it's not so small that you have no room to draw properly, and it's not big enough that you have to hurt your arm  with long movements after a tiring day at work. The price- I bought this for 20 C dollars at the local Radioshack, but you can get one for much cheaper online compared to a Wacom Graphire which is 4x5 and upwards of around 50 US dollars. It's compatible with almost every graphics software and works remarkably well. Unless you're a professional graphics designer, you won't need any of the costly Wacom tablets if you've got this.Cons: When I first unpackaged it, I was tearing my hair out for two days trying to figure out how to make this work in Windows XP. For all of you out there with a similar problem, download this driver for the newer versions of Windows and relax:http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/KBGearTablet.zipThe pen sensitivity will need to be set to your desired pressure-sensitivity first, so don't try it out before going to Control Panel and changing the settings. I find that the best setting to use for the barrel button option is Left double-click. :) Hope that helped a bit
1	Works As Advertised With the Exception of the Speeds. This helps my network tremeendously in terms of speed.  In other words,if you are supposed to get up to 8mbps, you will get it from your ISP.  I found that hard to do on my wireless network for some reason.  It doesn't necessarily do HD content, all that well though, but I think you have to get the more expensive one to do that. But it did allow me to hard wire my media center extenders to my network as well as my media center PC.  I have a much more secure connection now.   I do get speeds of about 40mbps most of the time, and I am reasonably satisfied with that since that is a pretty big jump in performance.
1	Great tool to have around the house. I really like this label maker.  I've been using it to label ski equipment and various household items.  I bought a roll of iron-on fabric tape so I can label my son's clothes for summer camp.It hooks into a PC easily with a USB cable in just a minute.  It comes with a PC application that's akin to a word-processor.  You can compose all your labels on your PC and then just select print.  Any font can be used and you can included graphics.The only downside is the cartridges of label tape are not inexpensive.  If you would like a few colors, you will have to invest in several cartridges that cost $12-20 each.  Admittedly each cartridge will print many many labels so it's only if you want a variety of colors that you would have to spend a lot on cartridges.
1	happy with the purchse for the price. Nice sound, I will admitt for the price, I get big sound, with quality.  Only thing is a humming, hissing sound when machine is idle. Ohtherwise, worth it.
1	Loudness?. First of all, these are good speakers, nice design but it has one flaw.batteries...A. it eats them up ...FASTB. if you use batteries instead of the wall plug in it comes with, it wont go as loud, and if it thinks your playing it to loud, it will start..skipping.. or something of the sort.But, it has good sound quality, and honeslty when your on the go, when do you really need it blasting?Also they are just..barley large enough that you cant put them in large jean pockets sadly, but it doesnt weigh much at all.And i really like how if i ever say..lost my Ipod somehow, it has a Cd player (walkman) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose the ipod.( the wall hook up also comes with many different adapters )
1	Wish it Connected Directly. This SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMate USB 2.0 Reader/Writer is a neat little device.  I just pull the Compact Flash card out of my camera, stick it in the ImageMate, plug the USB cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a camera/computer transfer or worry about draining the camera's battery.  I'm running XP SP2 and didn't need to install a thing.  I just plugged it into the USB port and XP found and recognized it.  The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it plugged directly into the USB port itself (like the Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 CARD READER -- though that uses SD/MMC cards instead of CF) instead of having to use the separate (included) USB cable
1	Easy to use, lightweight. This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what "hold" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use
1	A great buy to keep my shredder in tip-top shape!. I bought this together with my Fellowes shredder, and it has kept my shredder working in perfect condition. No complaints so far
1	LOVE IT. Bought it for my wife and she loves it. It keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. The display is small (no fancy menus like Ipod)but works well. Sound is excellent.Be sure to install the drivers and software. The software is small, simple and EASY to use - or you can just COPY/PASTE files onto it.If you DON'T install the drivers it only works at USB 1.1 speeds and takes a LOT longer to load songs. With drivers you get full 2.0 speeds
1	This does what it's supposed to do. This little microphone works well for me. I've owned it since August and now it's November 3. I use it with my Olympus WS-100 to take notes which I then save to my computer and import it into Dragon Naturally Speaking version 9 Preferred which then produces a Microsoft Word document. I speak into the microphone from about 2 inches away and am really careful with my diction and pronunciation because there is just a little bit of distortion if you over drive it. But with a little work in practice it does what it's supposed to do. Oh, one side note if you do import this into Dragon be aware you will have to make corrections. Sometimes a lot of them but that's based on how you speak. Or maybe that's based on how I speak that's been my experience anyway. But that's not the fault of the microphone
1	Does the job as promised. This is exactly what I was looking for: not too expensive, not much hassle with the cables - they are integrated with the unit, and no need to reach for the button to switch computers - simply press "Scroll Lock" twice to go from one computer to the other.Cables are pretty long, which is good: longer that I need at the moment, but I may appreciate the extra length in the future.
1	Good product. The positives are: excellent sound quality and perfect reception when near transmitter.The negatives are: the headphones quickly become uncomfortable. I prefer earbuds after using these. The reception is good when nearby or in line of sight of the transmitter. You're not going to get the advertised range if the signal is going through walls.Also, I did the boiling the headphones band described in this forum to avoid cracking. It seems to have worked. No problems there, other than my daughter and her friends thought I was crazy
1	Up and running in 5 minutes. I just had to unpack it and plug in the cables, then set it for a cable connection and that is it. Beautiful picture
1	Well whuduhya expect for 25 bucks?. On first glance uppon opening this package, I was alarmed by how small they really were.  Unlike lots of headphones, these seat on the ear rather than around.  They do have three speakers per side. However, due to how close the drivers are to one another being that they're so small, the 3D sound feild leaves more to be desired as far as gaming is concerned.  Good sound quality at low volume, and great frequency response.  Bass, as you can expect, suffers at elevated volume but is good otherwise.  Having volume control on your keyboard is a blessing with these.  They are durable, have a hideously long chord, and are too easy to instal.  The part that rests on the top of your head however, is just semi-stiff plastic.  I'll probably figure out some way to pad them better, but they can be worn for long durations out of the box.Bottom line, yes they're 3D.  Yes they're cheap.  They're definitly worth the money, but if your're willing to spend an extra few bucks, I'd recomend the Z-mans Theater6's, being that their front and rear speakers are way further appart.  From what I hear about those, they "require" an amp to work to their full potential
1	Great Carry Case!. This is a great carry case for the Sony TX series.  I just wish it wasn't that expensive...but this is a must if have you this laptop...for protection purposes that is
1	Easy. Within about 12 seconds of opening the box I was listening to my IPOD on my home stereo.  Wires are well made.There may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever
1	excellent little player. The more I use this player, the more I like it.  I see at least a couple of reviews of unhappy users who have either unrealistic expectations or haven't yet learned it's features.  True, it's not the most intuitive player for advanced features, but basic features are easily picked up and if you play around with it, you can figure it out the more advanced features quite easily.  This coming from a guy who thought he was getting left behind in technology.To the person who had difficulty changing songs while running. Easily addressed in two ways.  1- Run with it in your hand, it's small and fits well in a loose griped hand. or 2- learn to set up play lists.  You really should be concentrating on looking where you are going and what's around you (especially when your hearing is somewhat impaired), not flipping through songs.I find it appropriate for it's intended use (excercise, activity), maybe not for the car or trying to DJ with it.Software is not that bad, but defenitely not the best.  It's managable, I've certainly seen worse.Maybe because I want to, but I think I can hear a slight difference between the SONY ATRAC and MP3 formats.  The Sony does sound better.Yeah, needing a computer to charge it can blow, but the battery life is very good and how often are you away from a computer.  I'll find out how good the battery life really is soon on a trip to South America.Also there are not a lot of accessories.  No car charger/transmitter for this model (that I've seen), but again, you have to consider this model's intended purpose and it definitely shines in this area.  Would you rather take a full size IPOD or this thing running/biking
1	Great Value / Great Product. This Backpack has been the best invention ever..... since one is always taking care of their this on a trip or walking threw the city....And also a great value for what you pay
1	Privacy filter is a must for managers. I use the privacy filter on both my laptop and my desktop screens and it is a great addition.I no longer have to worry about people perusing sensitive info on my computer in meetings or when working in my office.The filters also prevent me having to quickly minimize my work when someone starts looking over my shoulder.A must for managers that work with employees' personnel info
1	Epson T048120 Black Ink Cartridge. This item arrived in good condition during the time frame promised.  It is a quality product which works well in the computer printer.  Thank you for delivering this product as promised
1	Right size. I was so glad to run across this product. I always have such trouble when I travel connecting all of my devices in hotel rooms. I can easy fit all 6 of my devices with their big AC plugs into it. Wish it came in black like the "Outlets to go power Strip 4" does...oh well.
1	Very good, high-powered stereo receiver. The fad today is for multi-channel audio/video receivers. But most people stiill listen to music with just two speakers and, consequently, only need a good stereo receiver. In fact, a sound stereo system featuring a good stereo receiver, such as this Onkyo, and an excellent pair of speakers will sound better than a typical multi-channel system which usually features several mediocre speakers. Unless you can afford a good multi-channel receiver and several good speakers you will get better sound by sticking with good stereo equipment. The Onkyo TX-8522 is a very good stereo receiver with a wide range of inputs and controls, including a remote control. With 100 watts per channel power it is capable of driving virtually any speakers to deafening levels (which is NOT good for your ears) even if you are inclined to apply significant bass boost. Although the TX-8522 is very reasonably priced, if you would prefer a less expensive receiver, consider the 50 watts per channel Onkyo TX-8211
1	Outstanding bargain. I am using these speakers with a very low watt Sonic Impact T-Amp.  The speakers respond wonderfully.  With the T-Amp they fill a medium sized room with really nice sound--very clean, very nice reponse across the frequency range.  I have not used them for really loud rock music, so I can't comment on that aspect, but they exceeded my expectations by a lot
1	Great phone... We purchased this because it expands up to 8 handsets, which is fantastic. Some people have had sound issues. We don't. It's very clear, no static of any kind. It's great that it's got the volume button on the side of the handset. The speaker is also clear, no static and loud enough (volume is adjustable).We're not into ringtones, but I wish it had a simple, regular ringtone. I hate the musical ones.We do like that you can set up a different ring tone for different people. That way you know who's calling without looking at the phone. You can also record your own sound.We like that you can check your messages from the handset or remotely.The base itself takes 50 entries into the directory; however, the handsets take 100 (that's strange). It keeps up to 10 redial numbers.The bad thing about the phone is that you cannot enter the directory into one handset and then send it to the others. If you have a lot of entries, like we do, this is a real pain.Another drawback is when you get a call, and you answer it, the rest of the handsets don't recognize that you answered that call. They will still show it as a missed call. This is annoying.Other than the little quirks (which we can live with), we love it. It's a sturdy phone, color screen, you can change the screensavers, adjust the screen contrast and it's got a mute button, which is great.
1	Great (as long as you don't live in California!). The funny thing about the MIC... there's a warning in the box that says it contains lead which is *believed to* cause cancer in the State of California (I'm not making this up!)    I have no idea what makes lead particularly more toxic in California than anywhere else, but my advice to anyone who buys it... do not EAT the microphone.As for the package... I'm new to podcasting.  (Actually I got it as much for the audio interface and to be able to do some voice overs for a project I'm working on as for Podcasting.)   I wound up getting the "kit" because... it would have actually been more expensive to get the mic then the audio interface. (You can't just plug most mic's directly into the computer... )    So by the time you get the Mic and the Interface, you're actually spending more, even without the software.I have had some minor configuration problems - - but all in all, everything seems pretty simple, and the instructions get to the point...  hence its useful, hence the * * * * * - - as to the opinions of more experienced users... let's see what they have to say whether its a good deal of not
1	Nice Ipod charger. I had no problems with this Ipod charger.  It charges rapidly and quickly and it doesn't over charge.  I carry it will me everywhere
1	Works well-- what's not to like?. I purchased this unit after reading reviews of a close cousin to this recorder, its predecessor, which is apparently very picky about the specific -r, -rw or dvd ram disk you purchase for recording media.  I've had no issues in this regard.  I followed the purchase recommendations in the manual for blank media, and the recorder has worked well for me.  Even when recording to 1-16 X DVD -R's, something I thought might cause a hick-up, I found no problem.I have this unit hooked up to a Panasonic Plasma TV.  I use it as the tuner for my non-high-def cable signal.  I have an alternate input for a television antenna.  This whole system plugs into a Bose surround sound home theater system. Since the DVD recordings cannot be in high def anyhow, using the Toshiba DVD recorder for a cable box works out well.   Were it not for this DVD player, I'd have to reprogram the Panasonic HD tuner for cable stations when I wanted to switch from the high def antenna input to standard cable. (I don't want to pay for high def cable service, otherwise this would be an option as well.)One issue I have run into, that was mystyifying at the time, is that if I have a disk ready to record in the dvd player, and I turn to the History channel here in Detroit, the copy protect mechanism in the DVD recorder messes up the reception.  If I simply open the disk carrier, so that recording is impossible, the signal clears immediately.  This is the only channel that I have this problem on.  I believe there is some sort of digital protection on this particular cable channel that the Toshiba responds to by distorting the signal so it cannot be recorded.I use this recorder to record many shows I like.  Unfortunately, I cannot record the history channel shows, for reasons discussed above.Other than this glitch, I really like this recorder.  The image it produces for my 1080i plasma when playing DVDs is outstanding-- as good and maybe better than a much more expensive unit from Bose.  The HDMI and optical output is nice to have, and the price is outstanding
1	Nice Cable - Works Great. After upgrading my computer's video to one of the high end card and upgrading my Monitor to a nice flat LCD (Norcent), I realized Standard VGA connection simply not doing the job.   I am running Windows Vista Ultimate and display was getting analog connection (with a lot of visible lines).   I went to some of the local stores and realized they are nothing but trying to rip people off.   I got this from Amazon and right away my connection changed from Analog to Digital and awesome display.   I simply love it.  I probably would have loved it even more if the connectors were gold plated.   But the way it is, does its job (very well, I should add)
1	Listening Enjoyment!. Great sound quality, got these to block out noisy co-worker, works wonderfully!  Love the color and style, very comfortable
1	Awesome!. Being a metalhead myself, I very much thought it might of overpowered the music (the phones that is.) I read very many reviews on these headphones, and thought it was right to buy these. They were compared to Shure, and Bose. but being a metal head, If you love metal, and/or rock, these headphones OWN especially the double bass and the heavy guitar riffs. If you love rap, I acquired some to see what these headphones could deliver, and it was amazing.5/5
1	great radio. I initially bought a black one and loved it soo much that I went and bought a white one. I have it hooked up by aux port to a mac mini and small wall mounted 19" lcd. Looks great and can listen to internet radio at night plus surf the web with a classy sound interface. The white colour and fit (I have it stacked on top)  also matched the mac mini perfectly so don't be afraid. All in all it's a great radio with good sound for a small bed room
1	good, but a little pricey. The tape was good but it was around 10 dollars and some places sold it for 8
1	Pleased. I like the solid feeling and the positive action of the stick. The twist is a little on the stiff side but not unmanagable. The twelve buttons are nice to have
1	Works Great on Vista. I bought this to watch and record tv on my laptop.  I had a hard time finding the correct download for Vista OS but their TS was very helpful and once I got it installed it worked great!  The HDTV channels look fantastic!  The remote works fine, and it has been easy to use.  Like one of the other reviews, I have 2 gb dual core processor so that may help.  I have not tried to burn a DVD with it, but that wasn't my primary reason to purchase.  The included antena works great.  Before you buy, you can go to the Pinnacle website, and do a search on your zipcode to see what channels have good strength in your area.  That may help in your decision. Enjoy
1	Does what it says. IT's a USB hub. All I ask is that it works. It does.
1	Volume is too high. I really enjoy this product.  I bought it because of the great reviews.  The worst thing I can say about this is the volume you set the Ipod to wake up to.  10 is the lowest you can go and when your in a dead sleep it can be very startling.  I am also having trouble hooking up the clock to my TV so I can watch my ipod video.  I think I might just need to troubleshoot it so I can't say for sure that that is a problem.  Other than those two things, I love my Iluv
1	GREAT plug-n-play product. This KVM works exactly as described.  I was a little concerned when I read the online manual because it says that the Mouse and KB USB ports are component specific.  I'm using a wireless mouse/KB combo from Logitech - it works flawlessly.  This KVM also supports the higher screen resolutions that a competing (top brand) product doesn't.  I also like that this KVM switches the audio (most don't) - therefore I can enjoy my high end speakers with both computers.  Overall it is technically excellent and available at a very competitive price
1	You can even bring this to the library. Forget about photocopies forever! This baby is small, thin enough to fit in a backpack and bring it with your laptop to libraries for research. USB powered make this scanner great for dorm rooms for the simple reason your computer runs it, NO POWER CORD!!! This is great for web work and for Graphic design and Illustration and even photo-manipulation. I am happy I purchased this
1	Great bag, very few faults. I bought this bag for my widescreen HP notebook and it fits perfectly.  There is plenty of room for the computer, the cord in the supplied cord pouch, a mouse and still have lots of room left over.  There are numerous pockets for discs, and a special seperate pocket for a jump drive or an MP3 player.  The only fault I can find, and this is a small one, is that the strap pad could be a little wider and more padded.  Other than that small issue this is a great bag at a great price, and stylish as well
1	Wacom Intuos3 9X12 USB Tablet. This is an awesome tablet! It has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator, photoshop and painter. The pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse. The size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time.
1	Great TV for the Money !!!. I purchased this TV for our bedroom and also to use as a PC monitor. It blows away my current PC monitor. Great for gaming. I'm very satified with this set. Highly recomended. It has just about every connection you can think of other than a DVI.
1	DEPENDABLE DVD. When I first got my Sony dvd burner I had numerous failure with burns. I tried several different brands of blanks with the same problem, big stacks of failed burns. When I called Sony to complain they suggested I use Verbatim. I did and in at least 150 burns I have no failures.  So naturally I'm hooked on Verbatim.  It must be the best
1	Hearing a pleasure. The earphones are giving a fantastic reproduction of classical and modern music, block out entirely the ambient sound (particularly useful for me as a frequent flyer), just need to be careful when walking around with them, you do not hear even a telephone ringing next to you.
1	Even I could use this product correctly. I'm anything but "handy."  This product was very easy to install--clear, concise directions in English, good pictograms and a sturdy, quality product.  I'd recommend this product..
1	Great system, but requires an investment. The Nike+iPod system works great and without a hitch, but to join the club, you need a $150 iPod nano, this kit, and unless you have just the right shoes, either some new Nike's or a third party accessory to tie the sensor up to your shoe. This kit is very durable; once, the sensor shot out of my shoe and landed in the snow. I didn't realize it for like 5 minutes. When I came back, I just popped it back in and kept running. The thing's really well built. While the kit works, I would've liked the Nike software on my computer instead of on the internet, and I would've liked better battery performance from my nano while I'm running with the kit. The receiver eats batteries for breakfast
1	Great drive, flawless for several months of use!!. If have the 40gb unit and work just fine, then I upgrade to the 100gb, even better, more space and flawless. Fast and reliable. Also a quite unit
1	Best Radio Value. My bedside radio requirements were: Front firing speaker, AM and FM external antenna inputs, aux input.  This radio pulls in my regular stations without have to rotate the radio or attach my Terk tunable AM loop. The rotating volume knob adjusts in very small increments to more closely resemble an analog control.  Press on the knob to toggle between bass, treble, and volume without have to look at the display or navigate menus.  The bass and treble control generously adjusts from -7 to +7.  Dial that tone in and turn up the volume. This radio sounds excellent!  The bass is ported in the back of the flawless black lacquer case and it will deliver more clear treble than you want. I wasn't purchasing the radio as a clock or alarm but the radio is worth buying even if you still need to use a separate clock (LED's are better in the dark anyway).
1	Worth the Money...MINOR drawbacks. I have owned this system since March...the sound is wonderful...definetly a great value for the money...the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers aren't used as much as I thought they would be, but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money...music sounds great, dvd is fine for the most part, no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time, recycling the power corrects the problem...it will also plays cd's that I burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do...and unless you are a sound snob, this system will work fine for you...and if you are a sound snob, why are you even considering this one...go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one can't compar
1	Port Computer Case. This is my 2nd Port product and I have been impressed with both
1	Great Product and good buy. I purchased thisTV in January 2007. It replaced a 20 year old 27" SONY . Boy, have I come into the modern TV age with a bang.This TV has a terrific picture. I can't speak to the set up as my son did it for me but he did not seem to have any problems and made very few adjustments.The delivery was smooth and uneventful except that it was delivered at 6:30 AM. I guess that is better than waiting all day.The price came down $50.00 the next week and Amazon gave me a credit.All in all a fantastic experience as always with Amazo
1	Good enough for the money. It does everything I expected to do. Easy manual and set up. Great sound. I am keeping it
1	Good buy. Ive had this fridge for about 3 yrs now- i got this when i was 17 or 18 and it still works great and is worth the money. Its perfect for teenager or college students dorm. Ive had this in the bedroom since then and i have gotten compliments on it and how cool it was and its good to store some drinks and you can have a decent amount of food or other things in there but it is perfect size for the bedroom but inside it is small to medium storage capacity- but for its smallness it is very powerful and keeps drinks and other things ice cold and also comes with a little freezer compartment which is also very powerful- id say it can hold about a case of drinks or case and half and some room for food- its better for storing drinks. But overall good little fridge with lots of power and nice silver design
1	Built like a tank and works flawlessly. I've had this drive for 9 months now and it's still working just like the first day.  I put it in my pants' pockets along with coins and keys.  No mechanical failures so far.  I use it to store personal info and to transfer files between home and work computers.  Initially I had to download the latest driver from Memorex Web site to make it work as advertised.  Highly recommended
1	surprising good. I have a pair of v-moda bass buds - and they are awesome, although a bit expensive... but the skullcandy buds come a close second - and I have gone through DOZENS of buds!  The only complaint my family has (we all experience this) - is that the buds make our ears tickle sometimes.  The volume control on the cord is PERFECT for using at work because I can listen at my "rather loud" volume until someone comes in and then I can reduce volume instantly and easily.  Sound quality is awesome!  If it were possible I would give these a 4.5 stars
1	Quite good. Good sound and relative comfortable for in-ear headphones.  The great advantage of these headphones is that they are very well made and you actually have to try to break them thus making them an excellent choice for running with your ipod.  The price is quite low/fair for the quality and sound
1	Price is unbeatable. I own a Sony MiniDV Handycam. I was having a difficult time capturing video footage with a USB cable. The image was so pixelated - even in the little capturing box. So, a friend recommended this product to me and so far so good. The transferred footage is crystal clear. I have yet to try all of the other features of this product - but so far, it suits my needs.
1	Older kid. The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses.  The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set.The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time.It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket
1	No issues. Using this digital cable between a Vista PC and NEC monitor. No issues
1	Great product!. After going through at least 4 CD player/boom boxes for my daughter (including 2 of the Fisher Price "Tough" ones, the Mickey Mouse one, and the Barbie Karaoke one), we bought this one.  None of the others lasted even 6 months, and they were all picky about certain CD's.  We've had this one for about 2 years and never had a problem.  It has been used every single day--usually multiple times.  It reads all of my daughter's CDs (which tend to get scratched and dirty), and she has been able to operate it since she got it at 2 years old.  Now my 21-month-old has figured it out as well, and we plan to buy another one for her this year
1	I gotta say... wow!. I have owned a pair of Etymotic ER6is and a pair of Shure's E2s, which are both very good quality earbuds, but I have to say, this is by far the best pair of in-ear-monitors I have ever owned. You really can hear the difference between earbuds with single drivers and these dual driver monitors. The lows and highs don't interfere with each other, which may may be difficult to understand, but you will when you hear them. No matter how low the bass, the highs are still constant and unaffected... and vice versa. However, in my opinion, the difference in audio quality between these earbuds and pair less in price (like Shure E2Cs, for example) are, what some may consider, subtle. But, for the true audiophile, this difference is just enough to justify spending so much on a pair of buds. I took these through a few brief tests when I got them, playing several mp3s that were rather bass heavy and have been known to produce poor sound on previously owned earbuds... and I smiled. The UEs played the bass clearly and the highs were bright and uninterrupted, the way they were meant to be heard. As for the construction and quality of materials, they could use some work. The cord is a tad bit cheap and I'm curious to see how long it lasts before shorting out, but that brings me to another absolutely genius idea they have created. A user replaceable cord. Everyone knows, cords short out. There is no headphone that will not short out. My guess is, the drivers will last quite some time, but no matter what, the cord will short out. Well, for $20, you can get a brand new cord. The old one simply unplugs from the buds... but don't worry about that just yet, because they have a very generous 2 year warranty. What more could you ask for? In short, I recommend buying these earbuds. They are the best I've ever owned, and if you have very picky ears, they'll appreciate them
1	Great deal. I was so unsure about buying a tv card, but ireally wanted one, so i was researching them for a few months and finally got the courage to buy this one.  Let me tell you it does everything i had expected, i have windows Vista home premium and MCE picked it up right away, didnt even use the disk.  Works flawless for me, definitely would recommend
1	Sounds good, great value. This JBL 12" subwoofer is a fine product, and a great value when purchased through Amazon.  The price was about 40% lower compared to what they were asking for it at Best Buy, all I had to do was wait a few days for it to arrive.  Plus there is no additional cost for sales tax, which where I live is nearly 8%.  This pushes my total savings up to 48%, nearly half price!  There was no additional cost for shipping, either.  This was my first Amazon shopping experience, and I'm quite satisfied.  I may continue to shop at Best Buy, but I doubt I will purchase from them anymore when I can get the exact same thing on Amazon for so much less.  Best Buy:  $430(price) + $34(tax) = $464(total).  I paid $240 total for the exact same thing new-in-the-box from Amazon.  Heck, if you really insist on spending that much then get 2 from Amazon instead of 1 from Best Buy and have twice the power to annoy your neighbors!
1	Great quality. I just received this for Christmas and so far I am impressed.  The case feels very sturdy with easy access to all the side buttons and expansion ports when open or closed.  The padded interior gives a nice snug fit while not scratching the Axim.  I haven't tried the belt clip yet since I probably won't be using it but it's a nice feature to have
1	Pleased with the purchase. I bought this for my 15 year old grandson, as a Christmas gift, and he has been pleased with it. I have not used it, but it has been invaluable for him
1	Works great but expensive. I recommend this product. Does the job but one can of course get away with a cheap adapter. I like it uncluttered though like this
1	Top marks for the Pantone Eye-One Display2. I read many reviews before deciding which product to purchase for monitor calibration.Before starting the calibration process I checked for product updates and found that one existed. The software update was a cinch.I'm pleased with the simplicity of this product and the results I've seen on my LCD monitor and my laptop display.If you're searching for a monitor calibration hardware/software product I'd strongly suggest looking at the Pantone Eye-One Display2
1	May be just what you're looking for. These earphones are cute and worth the money for:1. Replacements for iPod earphones2. Back-up earphones3. Cute earphones =)They tangle easily but that can be avoided by wrapping them around your iPod.They're cheap enough carry around anywhere but valuable enough to give good sound.I'm 100% satisfied =DP.S. They might be too big for a smaller ear, but that can't really be avoided with any other earphone.P.P.S. Go for it.Buy them. =
1	A Great Training Device for Bikers. I think the last reviewer said it best. Garmin set out to make a bike computer that blows away the competition. And they succeeded. As long as you understand that this is not your typical GPS device, with detailed maps whose primary function is to let you know where you are and keep you from getting lost, you will not be disappointed. The device gives you all the great features that you would expect from a high end bike computer; And then it gives you a whole bunch more.By using GPS you can keep track of where you went and use that data later to compare with previous rides. You can also map out your rides in detail after they are complete with Google Earth. The included training center software is good, but not great. The Motion Based website is a great addition (Though the EDGE is not compatible with the website yet) and between the two you should be able to analyze your data to your hearts content.It is an excellent training device and is very accurate. It acquires satellites very quickly and seems to keep track even in narrow canyons and pretty dense forests. It can also be used while hiking. It is very customizable and allows you to read as much or as little data as you want and you can set up that data any way you like.I first attempted to gather data like this with a Forerunner 201. That was a mess. That device provided one frustration after the other. Garmin appears to really have looked at the negative reviews that followed their initial Forerunner devices and really created a fantastic device that is truly created with the biker, not a runner, in mind.So any complaints? Just a few minor ones. The bike mount that comes with it is pretty cheesy. It is held on with zip ties. For $250 dollars I would like to see a little more. The bike mount you can purchase (for about $15) for the Forerunner is so much better. I hope they eventually upgrade that. The Flap that covers the USB cable port on the back of the unit is a pain as well. It is very hard to seat it properly. A little bit of patience and perseverance and you do eventually get it right. Other than that the device is great and highly recommended.
1	Just what we wanted. My brother and I were looking to replace our mother's broken CD player.  We wanted something that looked and sounded good and that was also easy to use.  Finding something with the last attribute, simplicity of use, without giving up the first two attributes was the hard part.  The Tivoli CD player was ideal:  One CD only, play-pause-stop, forward-back, that's it, and that is all that is necessary - and it is very attractive and sounds great.  It was the perfect gift - she loves it
1	Dymo Label Printer a huge help. I love this product. It is easy to use and very flexible with regard to what you can do with it
1	THESE WIRELESS SPEAKERS ARE GREAT FOR MY ELDERLY MOM!!!. Purchased these speakers for my 88-year old mother so she wouldn't disturb her neighbors with the volume up so loud on her TV.  They are WONDERFUL!  She LOVES THEM!! (And so do her neighbors!)  Also, they're apparently easy to install because an 80+ year old neighbor installed them for her.  So glad I bought them!  Highly recommended!!!
1	User friendly, works great. I bought this presenter right before a big presentation, and without opening the manual was able to use it.  I used it on a MAC, and all I had to do was plug it in.  Nice product
1	Excellent R G B Cables. The Monster Cable THX V100 CV-8 Component Video Cables are excellent connectors for DVD to Component inputs on HD and RGB (Red, Green, Blue component) capability TV sets. These cables are durable and deliver the best possible signal to your set. Any TV with Component inputs is going to give you a noticeably better picture than with Composite or S-Video inputs but the edge with these cables is their high-density double shielding and heavy gold plated RCA connectors, delivering a cleaner sand purer signal.
1	Logitech does a superb job with the Harmony 880. I was a bit skeptical about this purchase, although I previously owned one of the first Harmony remotes in pre-Logitech days and was very pleased with it. Some of the reviews were a bit off-putting, particularly about the 890 with its RF option, so I went for the 880 and I am glad I did. Despite comments from others the on-line programming was superb - all my components were already in the database.  Certainly I was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package.  In any event the process was hassle free and I  now have a fully integrated control for my Replay TV, Cable box, TV, Receiver, DVD and VCR just as I had hoped for. The control process is seamless, and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of IR commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great.  (The fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit.)  My only slight critique is that the remote does NOT have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off.  However the Help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again.  The rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too - I have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base.  Overall I thoroughly recommend the 880.
1	Comfortable. This earphone is very comfortable. I had to get one because my cat chewed up my original earphone that came with my MP3 player. But I'm glad I bought it because it's way comfortable than the one I was using before. It doesn't hurt your ears even after wearing for a long time, and it stays put well too. The sound quality is okay; it doesn't blow you away or anything, but you don't really notice it's so bad either. Most of all it's cheap. It's a good deal
1	Not sure if it's worth the money?  Read on. If you're like me, you are probably wondering if these little cables are actually worth the money. I was using cheap thin wired connections before, and my receiver would have LOTS of background noise and buzzing, so I thought I'd go ahead and give these things a shot. Afterall, I listen to MP3's all the time on my computer through my high end receiver. I'll tell you what, these things work great, and are worth the extra money. Now keep in mind, I'm an audiophile who is very picky about sounds. So for the casual listener who doesn't mind occasional background hissing or lack of crystal clear sound transfer from your computer to your receiver, you might be able to find a cheaper connection. But once again, I think the extra $$ is well worth it and I HIGHLY recomend these. Your only concern here is an economical one. As far as the product is concerned, these things are top notch.  Get the 20 feet if you have to go across the a long wall or room to connect your computer to the receiver, otherwise the 10 ft should suffice
1	Antec Sonata II. Great sturdy case. Well thought out design. Quiet. I call it my black Ferrari! The fantastic reviews of this product online say it all!the con: power supply went dead on me after 2-3 months. What do you expect when most cases don't even come with a power supply? Nevertheless, until I receive my new power supply, my adventures in Half Life 2 are on permanent hold
1	Dog loved it.... These are great in ear buds that have some noise canceling properties. They are great to use out doors when doing chores around the house. In fact these ordered replaced the original pair, because my pug Mimi decided to play with them and chewed the buds. She's fine but the buds were ruined! One thing I found out the hard way, is not to wear them on airlines when the plane is landing or taking off. The pressure differences will effect your ears. Great product...
1	Awesome for running. I bought these in hopes of better head phones while running because my ear buds just wouldn't stick in my big ears, they are nice and snug on your head when you apply them too. The design is just great. I've read that they are delicate so I am trying to be careful when I remove them from my head or place them some where.I rate this product 5 stars
1	UFO-Shaped Bounary Mike a hit with me. I have been happy with the ATR97 for years.  It captures voice very well.  It is compact, and unobtrusive.The one weakness is that there is no light to indicate that the unit is on, therefore it is possible to leave the unit on without knowing it, and run the battery down.  And then there's no way to know if your battery is run-down except by the terrible or non-existent recordings that result.But, overall it is a stylish boundary microphone.  I also like it because it resembles a UFO, or more accurately our domestic military industrial complex's "ARV - Alien Reproduction Vehicle."  Enjoy
1	WOW, THIS IS UNBELIEVEABLE.... All what I can say is WOW, I have a P4 3.2 Prescott which is known to be an extremely hot processor, now with this beast my idle became 45c and under load is 59c and that when the Zalman fan is running at the lowest settings 1300cc to 1600cc; on my previous Intel stock fan I used to get 55c idle and 78c under load.....However I gave this baby 4 stars because installation was extremely difficult, and I mean really a pain process where actually I bleed my fingers.And just to be accurate I used Arctic Silver Grease.If your processor is too hot like mine, get this and you won't regret it, and Oh, did I tell you that the PC is too quiet now that I can hear myself mumbling!!!!And also Amazon ROCKS !!! I choose free shipping which is suppose to be 3 to 5 days but Amazon got it on my door steps the SECOND DAY!!!! THANKS AMAZON......
1	TE SACAN DEL APURO. NORMALMENTE COMPRO DISCOS MEMOREX, LOS COMPRE YA QUE TENIAN BUEN PRECIO, AUNQUE NO ERA LA PRIMERA VEZ QUE LO HACIA.TODOS SE QUEMARON SATISFACTORIAMENTE, LAS VELOCIDADES PARA QUEMAR REALMENTE DEPENDEN DEL QUEMADOR
1	Excellent option to avoid camera cables. I bought this reader because I wanted to avoid having my camera and all its cable attached to my pc to download the pictures; and with this reader I could leave my camera (and its cables) in its case and just download the picture with the memory card, I recomend this product....
1	Review of Sony WM-FX197 Walkman. I've had this product for about a month, and I'm very pleased with it. I work in a store and I thought that there would be a static problem. The reception is quite good and very little static. The volume doesn't go quite as loud as my previous Walkman. The belt clip is a major asset for me. The batteries usually last for about 60hrs. The headphones are more than adequate. I didn't see a need to shell out more money for options that I wouldn't even use anyway.I thought the price was reasonable. It would of been nice if this product came with rechargeable batteries and a charger
1	Works Great :). I use this on my MacBook. Works flawlessly to hookup a TV via svideo. OSX handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that I use when i have it hooked up. Plug it in and video switches to tv settings, unplug it and its back to normal. I use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook, and i just get extra desktop space when I plug the tv in.The quality is quite suprising for s-video, very good.100% must have for anyone that has a nice tv :
1	Nice, basic  phone for the price. I use this phone in my office and I don't have a lot of desk space, so the slim design works out well, but is a very basic phone. Other nice features are that I can sit the phone in a standing position and can see the incoming calls, and a light flashes if I have voicemail through my phone company, BellSouth.  My only complaint is that the I wish the LCD lit up when incoming calls came in.  If the room is dark, you can't see the caller ID.
1	perfect addition to myfi. This headset is perfect. good sound and surprisingly good antenae reception. makes portable MyFi a delight to hav
1	3D Mapsend Topo Software. Works great on the Explorist 400. Has most of the new hairline roads so I can navigate myself while driving. Works well to see the elevation of the land while flying
1	Nice controller but compatibility issues. I bought two of these, actually, for two different Macs in an attempt to run Zuma with them.  They're really nice controllers, they feel great and there are quite a few buttons for different functions.  Yet finding configurable drivers for them was a pain.  We tried GamePad Companion but it made the device jerky and uncontrollable, especially when shooting.It's too bad someone can't make one that is easy to configure for the Mac users who actually enjoy gaming
1	Can't live without it.... I just love this little MP3 player. I have about 300 songs on it and still have 4MB left. I don't think I'll ever fill it up. I just can't live without it now. It was super easy to install, works with RealPlayer and Windows Media Player.  Also works great with Belkin Tunecast for the car. Just make sure the volume on the player is turned up all the way, or the Belkin won't pick it up and turn on
1	its great. the headset has a great sound for any use, either if its for gaming, chatting, or listening to music, the sound is excellent, i would recommend this product to everyone
1	Read the fine print... ...they're out of stock until April 1st.  Curses!  Now I'll have to buy the cheapo $600,000 grocery-store-brand batteries
1	You need this if you value your data!. I did some research on CDs and DVDs for my job, and I discovered that your average commercial-quality CD or DVD will only hold data for 20 years at most, and much less if they aren't handled with great care.  Data on hard drives will degrade over time as well, so you can't depend on that for long term data storage.  Think photos of your kids here, folks.  Have you backed up your photos lately, and are you sure that backup will still be good in 10 years?These babies are rated to hold data for over 100 years!  They have a special, inert chemical dye, and the reflective layer is 100% pure gold.  Seriously, the layer is thin enough to see through.  The technology has been around for a relatively long time, so it is mature.  I think every DVD burner you can buy supports it, and it has gone through all kinds of tests to prove that it actually works.There are a couple of other companies that second-source the technology, but these are the guys who invented it.  It's easy, it's cheap, and it the longest lasting backup media for your really important data that you can buy.  What's to think about?  Buy it already
1	If you really need floppy discs. Occasionally I just have to use them, but Macs no longer come with a floppy disc drive This fits the bill and requires no software - just plug in to the USB porrt and its ready to use. It's a bit slow, but perhaps that's just the floppies and they were always slow, it's hard to remember once you get used to the speed of CDs. When I finally use up all my old discs (not long now!) I wan't miss them
1	Great help!. Lets me know when my tires need air just by the color. Very useful for a busy mom of two
1	Works great. Better than the gold plated RCA cables from Radio Shack. What more can you ask for? I see no reason not to recommend them highly
1	Good fan. My original case fan was incredibly loud.  It doesn't pay to go too cheap on the case fans.  I'm not a 'modder' and don't spend time making the computer case look pretty, but I wanted a fan that would run quiet and help contribute to the overall process of keeping the case cool.  This fan seems to do both just fine for my needs.  The blue light it emits is a nice gimmick too.  The fan shipped to me quickly and without any troubles.  I would recommend this fan
1	Printer Cartridge. I have used the H/P 15 & 23 for my Deskjet 812C for several years, The quality has always been goo
1	thanks love it booya. thanks for buying me this i really appreciate this i expect that this guitar would be like a toy but I'm wrong it is so awesome so go buy this toy  and go rock and roll with your parent
1	Work even with very old Philips. I had been having trouble with multiple uses of my Memorex DA RW, but these work great, even with a 5+ year old unit.
1	Works perfectly. After reading the pair of "doesn't work" reviews from the same person, I decided to try it anyway, figuring that Amazon would do an easy refund if it really didn't work (also, I've had good experiences with other Sonnet products in the past).It works just fine for me. I've used it to connect an iPod and an iSight to the Firewire800 port on my Powerbook, both work fine. It seems a decent value and I'm happy with it
1	Very nice speakers. I read all of reviews and bought the item prior to the March 5th posting. And, based on those reviews, agree these are very good speakers for the money.  I bought these to use in my cube at work and they are perfect for that.  These are personal speakers and are not meant to fill the house with sound.  The packaging is beautiful, everything fits and works as intended, and I would recommend them to anyone, especially at the reduced price
1	Great Phone. I was a bit skeptical to purchase this phone based on the negative reviews. I am however liking it a whole lot. The menu is easy to navigate, the buttons are soft touch and the speaker phone is great. The design is also extra slick and looks very attractive.There could have been some nicer ring tones though
1	Fuji 1GB xD Picture card. This card seems to give the same excellent photos as my other Fuji cards. Love the huge number of photos I can take. Very handy when traveling outside the US with no access to back up
1	Easy to use but one minor complaint. I found the docking station to be very easy to use. It's great for recording TV or movies onto your player to watch later and the AVI format allows you to store lots of stuff. You can also set a timer to record TV shows like you would on a traditional VCR or DVR. The recorder even comes with it's own universal remote to use on your cable box or TV (I admit I haven't quite figured it out yet). Also, the station charges your player while you record so it won't die on you in the middle of recording a show. Apparently it will record up to 2 gig before making a new file which means it shouldn't break up your DVDs into more than one file. The station automatically formats protected media into special locked files. My only complaint is that copy protected files can't be played back on a TV or computer which can be annoying if you want to enjoy your saved DVDs on a normal sized screen. And it's tricky to rename those files on the computer because you can't open them to see what's what if they are protected. What does it mean? You aren't going to be able to share the movie watching experience on many files because of the protection. However, it's great for recording for personal use and you can even use it to entertain the kids in the car. I threw a couple of Spongebob's on my player via the station and my son was absorbed for the 40 minute ride to my parents. If you want to get the most out of your player you should buy this product
1	As good as it gets!. I brought this produce from Amazon and will keep going for this till I get hooked on to Blue-ray at some point in time... This is supposed to be one of the best DVD media's around and has lived up to its reputation
1	Fantastic quality and price!. These headphones are a great bargain for the size and sound quality. I take these to the gym every day and they easily collapse to fit in the pocket of my sweatshirt.  They are easy to snap into a comfortable position, they stay put, and have great sound quality to keep me going through my workout. I was looking for lightweight, foldable headphones that would allow me to hear the bass in my favorite songs, and these definitely do the job at a reasonable price!  Highly recommend!
1	This is not a color printer yet they don't say it in their marketing and advertise it as a full-function all-in-one. This machine works great except the fact it's not a color printer. I read the whole product description on 5 sites and at least a dozen reviews while comparison shopping for the best price and it was not indicated on any that it is a black and white. The ad says it is full-function printer and I think the color function is an important one. So I'm going to lose a chunk of money (on selling it and the shipping cost) and a bunch of time.I'm more thorough than almost anyone I know. They need to put that in the central description.Besides the fact it's not color, the machine is easy to operate, easy to set-up, a nice compact size, easy to see and press buttons, easy menus, and a nice look etc
1	Good reader. No problem with it... A little bit expensive but I had no problems with it... ;
1	HD ant. TV. It is good than I am expected.Save money for me over satalite disk or cable TV . My TV now can get most of the local chanel
1	Garmin C340 Charger. Received charger in 3 days. It was a Factory Fresh Garmin Unit.  No Instructions included , but it worked fine. It is something that you really need as the USB PORT CABLE CHARGER from your computer is slow as can be. It is a Needed Accessory
1	Perfect. The mount fit my Flat Panel perfectly and also included lots of mounting accessories to fit any type of screen. As for the mount itself it was extremely sturdy.  Well worth the price.  Best of all it was made in the USA
1	2-pack costs slightly more, but shipping is free. The 2-pack is currently $1.84 more than buying 2 cartridges separately, but free shipping is offered only on the 2-pack.I am satisfied with the ink quality, but the cartridge seems to run out quickly, hence the 4 out of 5 stars
1	Printer Compatible to Windows XP X64 Edition. One of the few rare and cheap printers that has support for Windows XP X64 Edition, as well as VistaThe printer works well and does it's job.Good job HP for developing printer driver support for x6
1	an excellent product. Although I give this product two thumbs up.  For those of us with parkinson's like tremors I'd say be prepared for a little difficulty at first but once you're use to it, it'll work fine
1	Excellent scans, a tad too slow. I used this scanner for about 150 frames of 35mm and 6 or so slides.  The scan times are a bit too long, but, the results are worth the wait.  The Digital ICE 4 suite of apps does a remarkable job of elminating scratches and worn out spots.  It has the slide & 35mm film mount adapters included, comes with Nikon Scan, Nikon View and manuals.  Nikon Scan could be more intuitive, but like all Nikon menus (including their cameras), they think differently than I do at least, so it took me a while to figure out all the different options.  The software found it slightly hard to remember my settings - it was a bit complicated for a scanner, but it is a near-professional scanner, so well .. not much room to complain.  On the whole, this scanner is worth the trouble - holds value well, and gives you excellent scans
1	great mouse. I got this mouse a few months ago and it works great.  It is a good size and shape.  The battery life also is good.  I would definately recommend this mouse to a notebook use
1	Canopus ADVC110. I got it to archive DVR'd material. Next I'm gonna try and use it to get all my audio cassettes and LP's into my MP3 library. It works like it should. Directions are a bit confusing, mostly because of the British terminology. But it could be a bit simpler. The dip switches and their settings leave a bit to  be desired. More plug n play would be better. Again tho, not a bad product for the price
1	SONY displays rock this planet. Whether you have a VIAO notebook, or a SONY plasma TV or a flat panel, or even a CRT, SONY offers one of the most striking and crystal clear images in this world. It'll cost you a lot more than brands like ACER, VIEWSONIC, or DELL, but mind you, SONY has been making TV's for a lot longer than any of these companies, so their technologies carry over to all of their displays.can't go wrong with this Japanese marvel of a company
1	works great!. Works great for me.  Set it up in minutes.  I hookedup my home desktop, and my work laptop via docking station.The only thing I do not like about it is that the USB ports for the keyboard/mouse are on the front.  I would have preferred they are on the back to be neater.  I have a wireless keyboard/mouse - so no need to even see the USB cable that goes to the receiver.Unlike the other user who indicated it does not work with multifunction/media keyboard - everything works fine for me.  Ie media, volume, favorite buttons.I use the hot keys to switch.  I might look into changing them as it says you can do in the book.I love how you can (but don't have to)seperately control the keyboard, usb devices, and sound through the use of the hot keys.  It works great.
1	Don't leave home without it!!. I've had this unit for about 6 mo. and I'm extreemly pleased, well worth the $550 I paid on Amazon. I've taken local and long distance trips, in car, van and motorhome. Very easy to use right out of the box, easy to see in the motorhome at distances greater then in a car, even with my sixty year old eyes. We live about 30 miles from Fort Worth and occasionally go into the city, we have used it to find banks, stores and places to eat. On a recent trip to Phoenix, AZ the guidance was especially helpful, I really appreciated the early warning to navigate the freeway interchanges, when to get in the left lane for left exit or how far to next change. On the trip it was helpful to find places to eat. On business trip to Houston I find the ETA info helpful to plan meetings. The remote is helpful in the motorhome, but I knocked off one star becouse of funky power cord connection, and no FM modulator.
1	Does the job for casual performance. I bought this mic because I wanted to make a homemade karaoke system.  A mic, music devocalizer, and nice speakers does the trick.  I couldn't get two mics to work together but I'm working on that.  As for quality, it is somewhat quiet but you can always turn up your volume for that.  Plus, many people don't realize that PCs don't run mic sound through the speakers on default.  You go to the Volume Control Panel for that and check the box Microphone.  The only two problems I see with this are it's sensitivity for bass (even knocking the cord around gets picked up) and that you have to hold it close to your mouth (maybe a result of mediocre uni-directional engineering).  Either way, it works for random fun nights of singing with friends but I doubt people doing real recording would trust this thing
1	Excellent product. I've owned this item for almost a full year and I am extremely pleased with it. It's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag. The side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small, but I guess I'll be able to find a purpose for them.
1	Flawless installation; excellent performance. I'll admit after reading some of these reviews I was a little weary of purchasing this unit, but I got it for $32, so couldn't pass it up.  I was replacing a LinkSys BEFW11S4 (wireless B).In a nutshell, I followed the instructions to connect the hardware, popped the CD in my "hard wired" desktop PC, took a couple of minutes to step through the setup screens (which are totally simple to navigate), enabling WEP along the way.  When I was done, I fired up my laptop (which has built in wireless-G card).  Network was detected immediately... all I had to do was type in the WEP key (which was generated from my passphrase entered during the setup) and viola!  Connected at 54 Mbps!!Awesome.  The setup procedure could NOT have been any easier.  I would recommend this device to anyone that already has a cable/dsl router (with a free port) and simply wants to add (or upgrade) wireless-G connectivity in their home.
1	Networking made easy!. This product is so excellent that I now own 3 of them and am heartily recommending them to all my friends who are networking-challenged.  I have one connected to my XBox 360 so that I can stream music, video and pictures from my computer.  I mainly use it to view my pictures on large screen.  Of course, I can also be on XBox live for games.The other adapter is installed near my ReplayTV for sharing video online.  I can't recommend this product enough
1	good deal. these batteries are as good as any and well priced to
1	Very good but it has little problems. I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.#1 There is no case for the card.#2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1#3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it.Otherwise its a great little expansion card
1	it's great, but has one small problem. It works great!  I really like it.  There is one small problem though.  The lid is REALLY hard to take off!  I've had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little, but not much.  There has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on, but isn't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it.  I appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion
1	iPoddish. My wife opened this from the package for me and the first thing she said is how "iPoddish" it seemed for a radio. Strapless, you must pocket this when walking. I wouldn't call this an exercise radio. It's more for travelling, mobility, etc. The internal AM/FM antenna is good for lacking telescopic function of bigger radios. The included earphone speakers far exceeded my expectations. Nothing cheap about them. Another plus: You only need one triple-A battery and this tiny radio, about the size of a lighter, is easy on power. Sleek, high-performing, including 5 presets each for AM/FM/TV, defaulted to shut off after 90 minutes to save batteries, and costing under $39 on Amazon, the DT-180 is a great choice for a "pocket receiver.
1	Excellent Price ($50) And easy to use. I loved the price on this one.  Also, having the USB Cord come out of it helps this drive to fit in any USB slot, no matter what is plugged in around it.It felt a little slow transferring data, but I'm pretty impatient.  It's also a bit on the big side.  I have already recommended this drive to several people
1	It definitely works... and its cheap. Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect?  First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work.When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly.  The driver software is very tolerant.  You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device.  So installation is a 5 minute process.Next comes the capture and initial encoding.  Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI.  Typical.  But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content.The frame rate is full on 30 fps.  It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal.  Both are just fine in quality.  The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up.  Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though.As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight.  It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.Bottom line?  This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails.  Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder.  Its a good value.
1	All one needs. I have purchased this DVD player to replace an older version of Sony DVD player that started to have problems playing DVDs (especially the scratched ones). Besides that I wanted to have a capability to play other formats (including photo discs, etc.). I think this was the right choice for the money. The DVD player handles every task as expected. Sony didn't disappoint
1	Really good product but not an IPOD. Great machine, the battery life of 12 hours is BS....it will last 12 hours if you have maybe 12 songs on it....if you are like me and have a libray of music then an IPOD is the way to go
1	Looking good so far... I really like this tv so far.  It is really good when higher def. shows are being played and quite awesome when watching a DVD.  In fact, it makes me want to spring for HD cable now.  It also set up with my current entertainment center a lot easier than my last tv set.  I would have given it a 5, but I haven't tested ALL the features out yet since just setting it up a couple days ago after my new entertainment center arrived for it to sit on.  But everything looks great so far.  The only problem I can say is that standard tv transmissions don't look so great on a HDTV
1	good ink on ink. Better packaging, cheaper than buying separately, HP- quality, and delivery in just a few days... anything better than that
1	Excellent mount. Easy to install 100% compatible. Much more convinient then the one that came with GPS
1	I LIKE, YES i DO!. OK, THIS IS IT IN MY OPINION: I WAS HESITANT TO BUY AS I AM GETTING VISTA PREMIUM SOON, (COMPATABILITY ISSUES), CHECKED IT OUT AND ITS FIND WITH VISTA, ALSO THE PRICE WAS HALF WHAT WAS LISTED, WHAT TYPE OF MANGELED JUNK WAS I TO RECEIVE? NONE, THIS THING CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION W/ ALL THINGS LISTED.THEN I THOUGTH THAT SOFTWARE WOULD BE OUT OF DATE, CORRECT! GO TO WINDOWS VISTA ADVISOR DOWNLOAD AND RUN IT, IT WILL POINT YOU TO THE CORRECT AND CURRANT DRIVERS ON ALL YOUR INSTALLED HARDWARE, IF NEED BE (A NICE LITTLE EXTRA GOODIE MICROSOFT HAS).ALSO SEEMS A BIT WEIRD ON HOW TO CONFIGURE DEVICE, BUT I FIGURE MAYBE ITS ME AND MY COMPREHENTION,(AS YOU CAN SEE I CANT SPELL TOO) SO I WONT FAULT IT FOR THAT.ALL IN ALL ITS A NEAT DESKTOP SET AND IM ENJOYING ITS MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF FEATURES, ALL FOR ABOUT 40 DOLLARS, I'M HAPPY
1	Mustek pl607 portable dvd player. This has a nice size screen. It only has 3 buttons.Play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it. I was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button. I just found this out by trial. There was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital. This would only last a second or two. At first I thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them. The volume control is on the side, as well as the power button. It could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me
1	Awesome Speakers. I purchased these speakers in order to be able to have some music on an upcoming vacation, and boy was I happy. the speakers fold up into a very compact size and even come with it's own case.  The extra adapter plugs allowed us to it in French Polynesia to charge our ipod, and since the speakers work with 220 voltage I did not even have to get a converter.  Outside of the hotel room we used batteries for power without any problems.  Most importantly the sound quality is great!!!
1	Always a need for a cassette player!. In spite of my computerized life, I still needed this cassette player for language learning tapes, my old favorite cassettes, especially those of my children speaking their first words. Now that's quite a lot from this little gadget . . .a true buddy it is.  So happy it was still available in this nano-world of ours!
1	Better then I expected. I had to replace the stock earphones that shipped with my Creative ZEN Vision M. After alot of looking around I found the Aurvana ZEN earphones and ordered a set.I am very happy with the performance for the size of these earphones and they block outside noise well.If you are looking for great BASS performance get some good to great Headphones because earphones just aren't big enough to pull off great BASS responce and never will be.With listening devices size can matter alot.If you want something that works well with a portable like an MP3 player or a laptop I would consider these to be a good choice
1	A great receiver. I recently assembled my first stereo component system (having had mostly single piece stereos for the last 35 years). I thought I might find "suggested systems" on the web, however, I ended up researching and price comparing for a month or so before my system was completed. Here is what I bought and some comments:1. The receiver is an Onkyo TX8222 with a "tape monitor function" which you need to be able to use an Equalizer plus to hear what you are recording. Although it has just 50 watts per channel, I have never had the volume over a third of the way up. The components below are all connected to it. From my research, Onkyo has a very good reputation.2. I already have an 8 year old Pioneer CD File type player which holds 101 CDs. It still works great. If it ever goes, I will probably get another with a larger capacity.3. A Teac W-600R Dual Full-Logic Cassette Combo. It has two tape decks, is reasonably priced and works fine.4. A Panasonic Technics SLBD20D Turntable. I found good reviews and this is a simple but solid turntable.5. SONY SS-MB350H Bookshelf Speakers (These are a Consumer Reports "Best Buy"). These speakers really are too big for a bookshelf and deliver very nice sound. I have them connected to the "A" speaker output of the receiver.6. SONY SA-WM250 100-Watt Active Subwoofer. I like bass and the addition of this subwoofer connected to the "B" speaker output of the receiver really enhances the sound.7. A Technical Pro EQ-5150 graphic equalizer. This is a nice unit and lets you fine tune your music. By connecting it through the tape monitoring loop, you can select any input source to your receiver and adjust the sound. This equalizer has 4 inputs labeled DVD, TAPE, TUNER, and AUX. There are two output connections. An equalizer really tops off a system.You also need something to hold all these components. You may want to look at an OSullivan Black TV VCR Stand - 20222. It has glass doors, three drawers, and adjustable shelves. I put my turntable on top and the other components inside. Try to buy it locally since shipping is otherwise prohibitive. I put caster wheels on it for mobility since it is quite heavy. I also cut a thin plywood backing with larger access holes for the back with access covers that attach with Velcro. I painted the plywood black. The wheels and larger access holes are a real life-saver as you connect all your components.For phonograph record storage I bought a Sauder TV/VCR Cart, Black 401082. I had to drill some higher shelf pin holes to accommodate the records. I also cut a plywood back which I painted black (much better than the black cardboard that comes with it) This unit has wheels and is a cheap way to store records.In summary, the above items have really made for a nice system and all the components work well together. The sound is incredible especially compared to the aged single piece system I previously had. My wife noticed the difference right away. I bought several of the components at Amazon and some at other sites when the price was better. The furniture I bought locally.
1	HP C6180 All-in-One. So far, I find this to be a very user friendly product. Having the small monitor screen on the unit makes it easy to operate and the results are above expectations
1	Casio Fx-115ms plus. great calculator, integrates, derives, solves, only problem is figuring out how to do this.  But best calculator for the Fundamentals of Engineering Test
1	All the memory you need but SanDisk is cheaper. This product works well enough and has an extensive amount of memory.  It is more than enough unless you take an insane amount of pictures or you want to take a 50 min video, in which case I recommend you just buy a digital camcorder.  If you are thinking about getting the 512 or bigger i would not recommend it because you will probably find that you simply dont need that much space.  However, if I could do it all over again I would buy the SanDisk which works just as well for half the price
1	sony  shortwave radio. got a great price from amazon on this feature-packed little radio.. did my research, this is my first swl radio in about 20 years...It's just taking a little time to learn the ins and outs of this radio..
1	RF Extender Works and Can Save You Money. I really like this RF Extender. I've used it on the H890 remote as well as the new H1000 remote. All I can say is that it really works. You do have to hook it up to your computer and program it separately from your remote. It has its own firmware. It's easy to do though. I haven't encountered any problems yet setting one up. I'm a professional A/V designer and installer. This is the new way to go. I've installed many hardwired remote IR systems in the past by Xantech and Russound. Those systems cost upwards of $125 on there own. Why not pay a little more and get a great universal remote to boot (H890 for around $250). It comes with a power adapter and IR blasters that plug into this unit then stick on the components you want to control. You can use a flashlight to shine on the face of those source components to help you in locating the IR receiver windows on your cable box/receiver/DVD player etc. (look for a round hole or LED shaped device) Anyways, this is a great product in my opinion
1	Great Card. The card is great, solid perfomer better than the ASUS counterpart as it is more stable. The only problem I had was with the CD that came with it, had a problem reading it on 4 different drives but the 5th worked. I recommend this card to all.although the 8800 has some issues under vista with certain applications/games, but on XP it runs great. I have connected it to 2 Viewsonic 22" HD Viewdock LCD, had a problem setting the display to be 1600x1050 on both screens at sametime, this was fixed by getting the latest nvidia driver.enjoy it, as it is a great car
1	100% perfect burns & durable. I got 20 of 20 perfect burns using these disks and Toast 7 on a G4 Powerbook with a SuperDrive.  I was cautious and only burned at 2X.  I'm using them to back up the original children's movies we have, since they take a beating. I've had them a month now, with a three year old handling them, and despite scratches, they are holding up well.  If they remain readable for more than a year, they will be the best disks I've ever bought
1	Magnificent!!!. Must say that the item was better than I expected. Thanks to the seller and will buy again!!!
1	It's Cheap And It Works. I was looking for a wireless card for an old IBM ThinkPad 390X running Windows 98SE. I considered the Linksys, a Belkin and a Netgear and after reading positive and negative reviews of all of them, defaulted to my standard: buy the cheapest one that'll work. I had quite a time getting the driver to install and that's my major complaint. Maybe that's the fault of Windows 98, who knows. The driver installation process kept hanging up because one or another DLL file was not found. I finally had to do some online research on this and also downloaded the driver and some other software from Linksys. I finally got the drivers installed and the card actually works fine. I would hesitate to recommend this to someone with an old machine who isn't very computer savvy, but it's a cheap solution that worked out okay for my needs
1	My early experiences. I bought the pen scanner because I have an application that requires scanning a lot of plain text to my PC. I am a two-finger typist so my hope is to use the product to avoid the typing. So far, the product meets my simple expectations: Scan-and-store and scan-to-PC. I have not yet encountered errors in scanned text. Customer service has also been excellent. I placed two calls to Wizcom's tech support and someone got back to me in less than 20 minutes. In both cases, the errors were on my side: First, I thought the installation CD-ROM was defective but it turned out that I had to reboot my PC in order to read the enclosed CD-ROM. I have had this type of problem with other CD-ROM applications. Second, I was unable to scan text to my PC in a notepad file as instructed in the manual. I repeatedly got the message "Error sending data to PC" and panicked, thinking that the product was a scam. It turned out the plug to my Pen (not the USB plug to PC) was not fully inserted. Once corrected, it works just as expected. I feel a great relief that I don't have the hassle to return the pen. I am satisfied with the product.
1	Epson Printer C64 Inkjet Cartridge. Epson maintains a high quality ink and cartridge design.  The inks don't fade or clog up the printer nozzles.  I caution those that use after-market refill cartridges that are not Epson Brand....My last printer was ruined by using a clone brand in an attempt to save a few bucks
1	Great Choice. I did a good deal of research before I chose this mount.  I was not disappointed!  With help from my 11 year old son, we had no problem assembling and mounting this puppy.  The lag bolts are more than adequate for mounting to the wall.  Final mounting is solid, and the articulating arm and screen-tilt feature make this ultimately flexible for viewing from anywhere in the room.  I mounted this in a corner, and get plenty of clearance for maneuverability.  Recommended this mount to a buddy...he ordered it and is very happy with it
1	Big & Fast!. Perhaps the ultimate addition to a good camera. I used my camera with a SanDisk Pro Duo (the blue one...) and while most times it was fine, when I needed to take pictures in quick succession - it let me down. The Ultra II is noticably faster. You will not regret buying this
1	JUST LOVE IT. I love my Street Pilot 2720. I work in Law Enforcement. The cruiser that is assigned to me don't have much. Instead of using the bean bag  holder I  fashion with velcro sticky back tape to my two cars plus my Cruiser. I use it 5 days  a week to check on about 10 to 20 houses daily.Plus locating abandon vehicles. I just type in the address and the street pilot does the rest. Before then I have to look in the the street map I haven't missed an address since thanks to street pilot 2720.
1	Perfect. This is the first DVD recorder I purchased. I used the quick set up guide and I was off to the races. The quality of my recordings are crisp and clear. The nero software is user friendly and makes recording dvds easy. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase plus I'm recieving a [...]rebate to top it off
1	Works great with all my devices. My remote went out on my Series one Sony SVR-2000 Tivo box and a replacement remote was $99 new and $78 used. Forget that. This remote works with my TIVO, Sony TV, Phillips Stereo, General Instrument cable box, Sony DVD player, and even my JVC VCR. Setup took 2 minutes for 6 devices!!! Best money I ever spent
1	Unbeatable Size and Performance for &lt;$150. I have, and have had, lots of SW radios including a number of Sonys.  This is one of their many gems.  Great perfomance, lots of memories and snazzy look. Good for travel (certainly not as compact as the SW100, of course).  A great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio, and don't want to spend very much. Good for listening, and good for DXing while traveling.  Look no further
1	Mintek portable DVD player. This DVD player is workaholic.The resone I gave it 4 stars, because after long use the hing for the screen brook off
1	Not bad at all. I purchased this keypad for the purpose of gaming and performing live electronic music, not data entry.It just arrived today, I opened the box, plugged it in and popped up metapad to try it out. So far, I'm quite pleased. However, the pressure required to press the keys is about four times what is needed on a normal laptop keyboard, and about twice what is needed on my klunky, classic desktop keyboard.That said, I still love it. I wouldn't want to spend 2 hours punching numbers into a spreadsheet with it, but I'm confident it will perform quite well for my intended purposes. But, I am hoping that it breaks in a bit with use. Also, the flat, ribbon style, retracting cable works like a charm, and it's exactly the size and weight I'd hoped (I'll post a customer picture soon).This thing is going to be great plugged into my laptop at shows, and I'm looking forward to playing my favorite space sim with a joystick in each hand and this thing just in reach without a full keyboard in the way. =
1	Why I still like this PDA. I bought this model in 2001 and still use it every day. It is reliable and has lots of software built in. I've added List Pro and Pocket Quicken. The only problems I've had are that the screen has gotten badly scratched, and I can't get the Compact Flash Jacket to read my digital photos
1	Great for cameras. I bought this for my digital camera because my other batteries didn't last very long. These work great and last for a long time.
1	Good, but.... It seems to run well and cool, no doubt because of its well thought out packaging.  Seagate has a reputation of producing good drives.I bought this as a portable "master drive" to use among two or more computers.  Why carry more than you have to?I thought that, to save space, I would get a few retractable USB cables to avoid the necessity of always carrying more of a clutter of cables.Surprise!!!  The Seagate uses an extremely special purpose USB cable to connect to its usb receptacle.  None of my other cables will work with it.  Firstly, the receptacle is so far recessed into the drive casing that an ordinary usb cable cannot reach into it.  Secondly, if you cut away some of the plastic surrounding the male end of the cable, it will fit into the receptacle but (Surprise!) it will not work.  Why? I do not know.  I tried several other cables that worked with other drives and devices but none worked with the Seagate.I tried searching for similar cables on the internet but, after searching exhaustively, found nothing.  You have to contact Seagate and buy another of its special purpose cables ($9.25 + tax/shipping each).The pretext of the odd Y shaped cable is that some computers will need a second usb jack for additional power.  Of course, this is rare and it strikes me as simply a profit enhancement dodge.Result: 8% higher cost and more cable clutter
1	What is all the fuss about??. I almost didn't purchase this CD player because of all the bad reviews it had been getting, but I decided to go for it! I am glad I did, I am very happy with this Sony Walkman! I use it for walking, listening to meditating CDs, audio books, everything and have not had one single problem with it. I am so glad I did not let the few negative reviews sway my decision! As mentioned in another review, I love that if you have to stop playing whatever your listening to it will pick up on the same track when you press play again, it also fits in my back pocket so I can walk around the house listening to anything while doing chores, the earpieces fit well, there is absolutley nothing wrong with this walkman! Those of you who seemed to have this walkman break in 2-3 weeks must not take care of your things. I love it, the price was great, so don't let the negative reviews stop you on this purchase!
1	Worked as expected -- pleased with purchase. The Reader worked as advertised.  I'm very pleased with the purchase..
1	You get what you pay for !!!. Set-up is easy and comes with a LOT of great software!! For under $10 (when I bought it) it is WELL worth the money - just remembering that ALL video capture devices will 'drag' your system when in use. Easy to 'snap' a photo and record video to your hard drive. Good 6foot cord so it can be placed most anywhere. Works very well in a 'hub.' Great 360degree turning radius and decent vertical adjustment. The picture quality is OK for most uses like online chat. It LOSES a 'star' for one issue: the main component is NOT going to hold to the base as it is all plastic; easy solution - get some super-strength glue to keep the capture mechanism attached to its base !
1	The Best Hard drive  for the buck. I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well.using : Seagate 750GB, 500GB, 400GB. daisy chained....
1	Effective Inkjet cartridge. I bought many inkjet cartridges for my printer.  I've recently had some that leaked.  But the cartridges I bought are effective in my printer, the cartridge doesn't leak, the ink doesn't run.  This is where I will buy my ink cartridges from now on
1	FujiFilm xD picture card. This Fujifilm 256 MB xD picture card,type M is small and compact.This card works very well.With my puticular camera it holds 129 pictures in the cameras highest resolution
1	This Product Does Work. I had a rare DVD disc that had developed a tangle of faint cracks, making later tracks unplayable.I used the advice given in an earlier review to use two drops of the repair fluid (aluminum oxide) for the initial cycle and single drops thereafter.  This was good advice and made some improvements, but there was persistent stalling and break-up in some tracks.The unit works by having an electric motor spin two cylinders, each of which rubs an annulus-shaped surface against the CD or DVD. The set comes with each repair surface attached to a flat disc with three prongs, mounted into a clear plastic base.  The buffing surface comes only on its disc-tripod.  To go between repair and buffing, one must use an enclosed small plastic brush-crowbar to pry open the surface between the disc-tripod and the clear plastic base.  This is not mentioned in the instructions.Also not mentioned is that one may buff more than once.  I ended up buffing four times.  This was probably more than necessary.  Sometimes one may put on too much of the repair fluid, which may find itself spread unevenly or left in small clumps.  The result is that areas of the DVD that had played all right before now break up because of irregularities or waves in the fluid coating itself.  My final cycle involved two larger drops, followed by using the repair cycle without putting any extra fluid on.  This may have smoothed the coating without the more severe action a buffing would have given.Now the disc works all right throughout.  There is some loss of picture sharpness, but it's acceptable.Along the way, I sent the customer service rep at Aleratec two e-mails seeking advice.  The responses were fast, courteous, and helpful.The product does work but needs more complete instructions and suggestions.  Skill rises with practice.   Be patient at first.
1	there it is. The price was right, it arrived on time, it works in my mp3 player, all good!  I should buy another one
1	Came quick, and priced right. How much packaging and instruction do you really need for a microSD card?  It came quickly, safely packaged in a plastic clamshell, without a lot of fancy colorful instructions, I plugged it in, and it worked perfectly.  Great buy
1	The Samsung 214T is an Outstanding LCD Monitor. Like one of the earlier reviewers, this is my first LCD monitor and I couldn't be more pleased.  My old monitor was a Mitsubishi flat-screen Diamond 200, and while I'm still satisified with it, the 214T simply blows it away.  At 21.3" the display seems gigantic and the picture and quality have to be seen, to be believed.  I'm running it under Linux, using an Nvidia GeForce 6200 and its drawing time is incredibly fast.  Thanks to the 8ms gray-to-gray response time, I haven't seen any ghosting or smearing, even when playing Quake.  One caveat though, whether you run this under Linux or Window you'll want to make sure you're running the latest video drivers.  If you're running under Linux make sure your video card supports the 1600x1200 resolution *and* that the card's pixel clock can run at the recommended 162 MHz rate.  Otherwise, you may see the dreaded ghosting etc., (by the way, this is true for any LCD, not just the 214T).In addition, the text quality at the recommended 1600x1200 resolution is superb.  The blacks seem darker than most of the LCD monitors I've seen (likely due to the 900:1 contrast ratio).  I do a lot of writing, so this was important.  If you do a lot of online reading or writing, then this feature will definitely save you eye strain.Finally, I ordered it from TigerDirect (via Amazon of course) and I was very happy with the service.  It arrived a day early, in the original packaging and there were no dead pixels.  I haven't tried the analog connection, but the DVI digital connection works perfectly.  All-in-all, I am very satisfied.  This is one of the few products I own that really deserves the 5-star rating.  And considering that just a few years ago, 15" LCDs were going for over a $1000, at this price it's a steal
1	Pricey, but for a Good Reason. This is a great card to use for your 8 megapixel digital camera. I have the OLYMPUS C8080, and at the highest-quality camera settings, I can get 254 color shots from this card. SimpleTech is my favorite brand, because I've never had any of their cards fail on me, even after repeated washings. Oops.This CF Card is totally dependable. SimpleTech is pricey, but you're paying for quality, which is cheaper in the long run.
1	As expected. It comes in the retail packaging and a little clear plastic case which holds both the card and the regular SD adapter. I got it for my LG CU500 phone and so far no problems at all
1	...some advice for the backplate during installation. This is a very, very good cooler.  I run ~15 degrees celsius cooler, under load, versus the stock AMD hsf combo.Measure the dimensions of the area in your case above and to the sides of your CPU.  This thing is HUGE.  In a full desktop case, I could only install this after completely disassembling the machine, and then cramming everything back together by flexing the motherboard and the heatpipes more than I should have.Not only is the setup wide, it's very tall.  My case cover barely slides over the top of the fan.During installation, follow all of the packagted instructions, except for the step that tells you to remove the backing from the motherboard side of the retaining bracket.  If you don't expose the sticky side of the pad, you'll be able to reuse this heatsink
1	best review for a piece of luggage!. I have a large laptop Toshiba qosimo and had no luck locally to find a case to carry it in. The description of the Targus case was accurate to the letter and accomidated my laptop, allowing me to take it on trips. For luggage, it totally fulfilled my objectives. I easily recommend it to others with wide laptop computers.
1	Great Value!. Everything you need to go on the road with your iPod.  Car Charger, headphone splitter, cassette adaptor (I'm not convinced that the FM Transmitters are very good yet), extra ear buds, USB & firewire Cables.  All in a sleek- not cheezy carry pack.  At least an $80 value for less than $55.  You can't go wrong.If you travel at all and would like to use your iPod more when you travel- this is for you
1	3 weeks into this bag. Bag is holding up great vs commuting on buses, by car and also being used for a tote while volunteering as a naturalist at the local parks. I can verify that it is mud, fresh water, salt water, blackberry bramble and dog proof and has left my laptop functional and clean at the end of each day. Even dropped the bag once and the computer was fine. Oh and the bag got punted while standing on the bus and everything was fine as well.  No sign of the seam ruptures noted by an earlier reviewer - there has been much abuse..
1	USB wireless adapter with external antenna. This adapter was purchased to provide an external antenna connection. for my notebook computer.  It performs as advertised. I connect a Cantenna, high gain external antenna, for an experiment to see how far my son and I can get are notebooks to communicate with each other in case of an emergency.  We are both Amateur Radio Operators and channels 1 to 6 are in the Amateur band, where we can use up to 100 watts of output power.I must disable the internal wireless in the notebook when using the Hawking adapter and disable the Hawking adapter when using the internal wireless, which makes sense to me. Eventually I want to get an 2.4 GHz for more distance communications
1	It's a Sony. I have had no problems with this unit or software that was bundled with it. Plug-n-Play, yes it was!
1	Great Product. The 7200 system is great, very easy to use, a breeze to set uo, both software wise, and physically in the car.  Day to day operations are also goof proof.  The mount supplied is very handy when you want to remove the unit from view. An excellent buy
1	Perfect TV. The ordering, the shipping and the TV itself was a nice experience.  I've had the TV for over a month now and it has been a nice experience
1	Great Fan. I liked the looks of this fan, read the other reviews and decided to try it. The fan is not noisy at all which is what I wanted because I watch TV in the room it is in. But I also wanted it to cool the room quickly. The ionizer is plus because it also takes care of the smells from the kitchen that carry into this room. The remote is a plus! Easy to assemble, easy to use, has a remote, is quite, and helps with odors
1	easy to install and no problems. Just installed one on my Dell 4100 running ME.  The driver installation process was the shortest that I have encountered.  It was just a few seconds.  Now, I do not have to crawl under the table to change out USB cables.  Great product.  Ebay's prices seem to be similar to Amazon's
1	Great item!. This docking station is small, light, and terrific...has many ports and sits behind the notebook, not under it...Was able to plug in my old HP 5M laser printer!
1	Excelente antena wireless. Comprela con confianza que es un excelente producto. Yo he comprado varias para mi uso personal y para varios de mis amigos. Los cuales han quedado satisfechos al igual que yo
1	Retro Charm, Sturdy, Fully Functional. if you're looking for an old fashioned phone without the dialing action, this one fills the bill. great sound quality, nice weight, good button response, and so far, no glitches. it even has flash & redial buttons cleverly disguised in the center of the keypad. no caller id lcd or phone number memory, but that would really spoil the retro charm. we use an antiquated ameritech caller id machine with it, and the two get along fine
1	Niccccceee. this thing is nice, i would have gave it 5 stars but when i received it, it had a scratch on it, but i was too lazy to return it. but honestly this is worth the money. the case has scrathes all over but it still looks nice and my ipod still looks ne
1	Good media, questionable customer service by seller. The DVD+R media is the best for data archiving and error correction and Taiyo Yuden makes the best media so does that mean that Taiyo Yuden is the best of the best?  Maybe, all I know is the media works great in all my drives without any problems with a drive recognizing the media.This review is mainly about the media but I do want to insert a side note. The picture of the DVD+R media shown is inaccurate. The picture shows the media in a cake box spindle and what I received was a tape wrapped spindle with no cover. I contacted the seller and was told that there was an error in the picture but that they would ship out a cake box to me immediately. One month later and I am still waiting. Not a HUGE deal but, I kinda expected the cake box storage and as such I now have to find another way of storing the empty DVD's.Still a great value and a great product
1	good program can be improved. I have used Microsoft streets and trip, and then I bought this program. In some respect it is better and in other respects it is not. This program was designed for the stand alone gps system where as the Microsoft s&t is a general purpose program with lots of commands and options. The Map system is better in Microsoft, but the guidance system is better with Iguidance. It has 3d views, better voice and better user interface. All in all it is worth buying if you have a laptop or a pda and a gps receiver it gives you a cheaper way to solve your gps problems.I have used Pharos, Holux and Globalsat's Gps receiver. Of the three I like to Globalsats bt-253 the best. It does not lose signals whereas Pharos seems to lose the signals. It may be a little more accurate because of the number of satallites that it can get being a 20 channel one. As far as map accuracy and uptodateness of maps, I really don't know about areas other than mine. It seems to be very uptodate in the Sanfrancisco east bay area
1	Thinking of Buying Another One!. I'd been using an older model Panasonic Velcroed to my treadmill. It had served the purpose for a while but, as I'd inherited it from my 14-year-old stepson, it had seen better days. It skipped more and more and I never could remember how to operate the hidden controls.I decided to buy a new one and did a lot of research. In the end I agonized over whether I should buy another Panasonic or a Sony. I finally picked this one for a couple of reasons: 1.) I have the matching cassette deck and it has performed flawlessly and 2.) I like being able to see the controls.Well, I've had the S2 for a few weeks now and it is absolutely wonderful. It hasn't skipped even once no matter what kind of CDs I've loaded it with. The controls are easy to use, even when going full-tilt boogie on the treadmill. I highly recommend this puppy. In fact, I'm thinking another one is in my future
