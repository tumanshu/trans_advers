0	Expensive but doesn't last. I had this opener and tried it with about a dozen cans and it lost its sharpness and now it was in the trash can.  It's expensive for such a gadget and didn't work
0	Faulty design - poor service - unacceptable support. We purchased a Hoover bagless canister in May 2004. After about 6 months the electrical connection between the hose and wand broke due to a very poor design. We took the vacuum to a local service center on 12/31/04. It's now March 15th and we still do not have a working vacuum. The local Houston service center failed to return our calls three times despite repeated promises. We were given the same incorrect part TWICE - once from the local center and again shipped from the central Hoover customer support center. We were told that the parts are back ordered from North Korea!I will say that the central customer support center personnel were helpful and positive, but it's been almost 3 months and still no resolution.We are very disappointed in this product and the support and we will not buy Hoover again. The vaccum is poorly designed and if you repeatedly disconnect the hose from the metal wand to use the accessories, the connection will break. Also, the unit is described as having a HEPA filter, but about 25% of the exhaust gas leaks past the filter out the back of the unit
0	Norpro 790 Stainless Steel Oil Mister. Junk will not pump after only a few uses
0	Over a month now - but no show yet. I placed a order on Jan 27th with 2 day shipping for this product. Its 21st Feb now and still it has not arrived. I just hope to see it one day
0	One word - Mold. Throughout the years I have used and owned many different versions of the Brita Pitcher Water Dispenser. All of these filtered water containers have been great. The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size. The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products.Pro:Size: This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (Ironically, this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.)Con(s):Mold: If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days, you will get mold. This mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). To avoid this problem, the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to be safe you should wash it more often). I have never had this problem with Brita's other products (I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months, and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it).Left Over Water: Due to the faulty design of the product, there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. Besides turning the product upside down, you cannot dispense all of the water. This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. Not surprisingly, this helps further contribute to mold growth.Conclusion:Save your money and buy Brita's other well designed pitchers or even Pure's pitchers. (The key word is pitcher.) You will only waste time and possibly your health with this poorly designed product
0	Not for serious Chinese cook!. I bought this wok 6 months ago. I seasoned it very well and started to use it. But I noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when I cooked the dish with a lot of sauce. It meant I couldn't use it for steaming. When I made a fried rice, I had a hard time to clean it and re-season it. Most Chinese use a wok to cook everything, so I expected I could do that, too. But I was wrong. This wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry. That's all
0	Bought it, tried it, returned it. One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer.The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the "flip it" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the "dirty water" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.  This contraption is not your answer.On a side note, I wrote to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop (what an excellent product), so I'm hoping that they will one day
0	Steamed!. Once in a while the coffee side of the machine will spew steam out the back and I will get a half of a pot of coffee.  The big problem with this piece of junk that the coffee maker was under a cabinet and the steam was ruining the kitchen cabinet.  I say this is $199 down the drain.  I have never had problems with a coffee maker spitting steam out the back and no water dripping into the pot.  Stay away from this garbage.  I am not even interested in contacting Krups for any warranty repair because it is not worth it
0	Not thrilled. The plates were warped and the color was off from the original set
0	Broke within the first week. I bought two of these humidifiers. One for work and one for home. They both broke in the first week
0	Hate it!. I can't believe I spent good money on this vacuum.  I've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems: why it won't vacuum without pushing it with all my might, why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children, why the filter won't stay in place, and why it SMELLS LIKE BURNED RUBBER every time am forced to use it.  I have replaced every filter and belt.  Now I am going to throw it away.  I'd gladly give it to charity, but I can't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim
0	FLAT Pillows. I purchased four of these pillows! I really shouldn't have wasted my money. They fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up, i'd rather sleep without a pillow at all!!
0	A terrible product. After the first few weeks, the novelty wears off and what you are left with is a toaster that doesn't work very well.  It is a very SLOW toaster that does not accomodate large pieces of bread.While the basic idea of making egg and muffin sandwiches is cool, the implementation is poor.  What you need to know is that the egg is cooked by boiling a measured amount of water.  The steam cooks the egg, but it also condenses all over the egg - leaving you with a soggy sandwich.
0	So long So Long Stemless. I thought this glass would be of better quality than it is. It took 3 shipments (re cieved and returned) to get my complete order without any breakage. These glasses are too fragile and in practice, impractical. Because of the design, one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass. Not too appealing when you are observing the "legs" of your wine.Recommend that you pass these by
0	Quick-Cup versus Eco-Pad...Winner is Eco-Pad!. I have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the Senseo Coffeemaker.  Folding filter paper didn't work....too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee....The Quick-Cup sounded like a good idea....but it doesn't fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee.  I found that the Eco-Pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well.  The key to any of these re-usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter.  The pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee.The Quick-Cup and the Eco-Pad are essentially the same design but the Eco-Pad fits the holder correctly and the Quick-Cup is slightly small.  Buy the Eco-Pad, it works.  The Quick-Cup would work if you could rig a small rubber band seal between the Quick-Cup and the holder...a gasket, to prevent the water from going around.   Good Luck
0	Stopped working after 1 yr. We actually had 2 of these. The first one-- the plastic pot cracked after 2 weeks, and we got a replacement as an exchange. The replacement worked great for 14 months, and it died suddenly. We've been taking good care of it, boiling water 2-3 times per day for tea, noodles, etc... The water boiled really fast while it worked
0	The colors come off after using it for couple of times. Hi,The pieces look real good.However after using it for couple of times, the colors startcoming off. It then looks real drab and I am bit worried ifthe paint is harmful to you since it keeps coming off.I'd not recommend it - irrespective of the price.
0	OK for the price. My Grandma baked EVERY day and always used a Sunbeam mixer.  That is why I bought this one, but I am disappointed with it.  It is very reasonably priced and the motor has been powerful enough for the baking that I do, but those are the only two good things I can really say about it.  When mixing, ingredients fly out of the bowl all over the counter and me.  When adding flour, no matter how slowly, a cloud of flour dust covers everything within about a 5-foot radius of the mixer.  I have even tried mixing with a towel over the top of the mixer just to help eliminate some of the dust.  Also, I have arthritis and have found the beater realase button extremely hard to push.  I guess this mixer is a good buy for someone who will not use it very often because it is a good price, but a person who will be using it a lot may want to invest in something better
0	READ THE FEATURES!. I was misled by the picture of 13 bars (a complete set).  I got 5 bars which does me no good.  I want to change them all.  I am sending back and getting a complete set, for $50.
0	Terrible streaking. I've tried this product many times using different methods and every time I end up with horrible streaks all over my applicances.  I'm not the only one.  Do a search on Google (...) and read a ways.  It seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product.  Others recommend using Weiman's or Bar Keeper's Friend.  On the plus side, it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you don't mind the streaking
0	Coffee gets cold very quickly. Nice looking mug and No spills but, you better drink your coffee very fast.  Terrible insulation system.  Don't buy it
0	UNSAFE AND POOR QUALITY TOASTER. Toaster was UNSAFE and defective.  Timer became weak after only a handfull of uses.  Would not go down to 0 time and shut off.  ALMOST BURNED HOUSE DOWN!Overall consrtuction flimsy
0	parts break easily. When we first got it, we loved the suction and filtering.  Our son has asthma and this is a good choice for keeping high air quality.After the first year, the hose got cracks, then a few more months in, the belt and clutch went.  These are expensive repairs, so you really pay for this vacuum.I thought you pay a high price upfront, you'll be covered with high quality lasting hardware, but nope.  You may as well just get a lower priced, higher performing machine
0	Poorest Dirt Devil I have ever purchased. The Dirt Devil M08245 Power Reach sounded just great in the advertisements, but has turned out to be a major disappointment. While the product is easy to clean of dust and debris, the roller assembly if worthless. The brush stops in contact with any surface and does not perform at all. Even very light pressure from your fingers will stop the revolving brush. You are simply left with a suction hand vac without the benefit of a brush. I am sorry I bought this product
0	Two machines one cup of coffee. I ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback. We followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee. After that the machine said "ventilate". We followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself. Went to make another cup of coffee and it said "ventilate". This time it would not fix itself. I tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray. Turn off the knob and "ventilate" comes back up on the screen. Turn the machine off and turn it back on, "ventilate" came up on the screen.We called Amazon and they sent us a replacement a few days later (thank you Amazon). Unfortunately, this one I did not get cup one out of the machine. It read "ventilate" as soon as I turned it on. The difference is with this one no water would come out at all.Gaggia provides no customer support so you are on your own with this unit
0	Mine Leaks. Please see my review of the 'Mr. Coffee AR5 4-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, Black'.  We're on our second one and both leaked, badly
0	Dyson Zorb Carpet Powder. It won't clean any spots but it will freshen the the smell, if any, and awaken the nap...no pun intended.  It refreshes and renews with relatively little effort.  We have 2 dogs and they have had no adverse reactions.  So, in between carpet cleanings this product will give your carpet a pick-me-up.
0	Two Defective Units. I thought this toaster was great when I forst got it.  It looked sharp and made great toast.   But after two months the chrome on the first unit started to pit and blemish.  Amoazon immediately took it back and sent out a new one.  When the new one was recieved, the lever on it was defective and it would not lift the toast out when pressed.  Amazon was great, as usual, but with a toaster with a price tag like this one should expect better
0	Butter dish not tall enough. It looks nice but the lid touches the top of the butter and sticks to it
0	The lids are toooooo TIGHT and don't fit properly!. I recently purshased this set and have had real problems trying to get the lids to 'snap' on.The majority of the lids alMOST fit, which is somewhat frustrating in itself.  I've tried pressing, pushing, popping, and even putting all my weight on the lids without success.  Swearing didn't help the lids fit any better, either.  No surprise...it seldom does.  I even tried pliers to try to snap the lid on the oval piece.  Only succeeded in breaking the lid.  The aforementioned swearing rapidly graduated to cursing, although no hair cuttings, nail clippings, hatpin-stuck small dolls, nor sacrificial small animals were involved.  And, the lid STILL didn't pop onto the cookware.You just have to marvel at how the lids can come sooooo CLOSE to fitting...but, just absolutely refuse to go that extra hair's width to make the seal.NordicWare....WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THOSE LIDS???!!!!The lid issue aside, I've used the cookware frequently for storing leftovers in the fridge and for microwave reheating of same, and the cookware works fine.  It cleans up well, and it looks nice.There, I've said something positive.But, again...NordicWare....WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THOSE LIDS???!!!
0	bark deterent review. The item didn't work at all.  As a matter of fact.  My dog didn't even flinch when I tested it right next to her head.  No, she's not deaf either.  We yell for her to stop barking from across the house and she hears that fine.The item actually melted in the sun (it still worked though).  I was going to return it but it said it had to be in good condition and it was all warped from the sun - oh well - lesson learned.I'm not trying to sound bitter but don't waste your money on this item.  I'm gonna try the shock collar next.  Maybe I'll have better luck.Thanks anyways,Mik
0	A big dissapointment. I heard about the lids and hoped that they would be a good alternative to plastic wrap. I even bought two for gfts.  But they didn't live up to my expectations.  The large size didn't even fit on standard size bowls and the small one didn't fit on small bowls.  I would return them except that I threw out the original packaging.  I don't recommend this product
0	This product doesn't suck... that's the problem. I don't get it-  so many honest people struggle to stay in business each day, but these guys are still going. The sad part is, this machine would be good if it actually worked for more than 2 weeks. I want to say it sucks, but that's the whole problem... it doesn't.
0	Absolutely HORRIBLE. I have used electric skillets for years and years.  I was so excited to get this new one because I thought the removeable pan would be a huge plus.  That idea was a huge plus BUT the pan itself was absolutely awful.  Everything and I mean everything sticks to this surface.  You can actually see while scrubbing lightly that the coating just comes right off.  Although that being said...it's no great loss because it didn't work anyways. I definitely would NOT recommend this!!!
0	Keep shopping. I have owned this blanket for less than a month so I cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability, but the first (and only) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime, and the dye used on the "moss" green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent.  I gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm, and has an attractive weave
0	A Lot of Money for a Very Little. Don't be fooled by the name "Emeril" on this knife. This is a light duty knife at best. The blade is extremely thin and has little or no weight. Spend a few extra dollars and get a knifewith more quality and more weight
0	Wish We Had Read the Reviews..... This timer worked for approximately two weeks. We noticed it had failed because the appliance did not go on as programmed. After many attempts to reset it, we decided to return it and report is as damaged so that it had to be removed from the merchant's inventory
0	Don't waste your money on this one. First of all, this is a very attractive machine sitting on the counter, but that is pretty much all.  The water container holds just barely enough to brew four shots before it needs to be refilled.  Speaking of which, refilling is a pain because the container is in the back of the machine, so I actually had to pull the machine out to the edge of the counter to get to it.  With this one, you need as much water as you can possibly get, because it drips water everywhere.  The first pull of the steam handle will give you about 2 oz. of water along with your steam, just what I DO NOT want in my milk.  In the mean time, the brew head will happily drip another 2+ oz. while you're steaming away.  Finally, there is the brew it's self.  Inconsistent doesn't even begin to describe it.  You never know what you're going to get out of that brew head, but you can bet you'll end up with a soupy mess of grounds after.  Let's see, what else... the drip tray is difficult to remove without sloshing a mess of stuff on the counter, the cup warmer is useless, the machine is VERY noisey, and just a piece of junk in general. No, this machine is definately not a keeper.So, before returning it, I did give Espressione a shot at making it right.  I sent an email to the warranty address, as well as copying several others within the Espressione group.  13 days later I got tired of waiting for a response and called.  Apparently there is 1 tech in the US to work on this thing, and he is VERY busy.  Wonder why!  So, I told the lady that I was pretty displeased with the machine, and their warranty service.  She responded that she understood, and another brand might be better suited for me.  Hmmmm... at least she is honest
0	beautiful but breakable. these are really beautiful glasses, and incredibly light.  we have no dishwashwer, though, and i broke one the first time i washed it (putting the dishsponge down inside) - and i was being careful.  these are really, really delicate.  my husband broke one the next day.  we also got the white wine version of these glasses, and one was broken upon arrival - still wrapped in its bubble wrap.  i have no idea why bodum decided to make these of such incredibly thin glass.  they're really beautiful, and we love using them, but it's ridiculous to have to be this careful with them - i mean, we have other wine glasses that i used to think were delicate, but these bodum ones take the cake.  we also bought the double-walled bodum glasses, and those are beautiful and much sturdier (although they're not for wine.....)
0	No effect on the dogs. I picked this up after reading the 50/50 reviews.  One of our dogs ran over to it and jumped up to see what it was as it buzzed away.  The other just wandered around and took no notice.  Neither seemed scared/bothered at all.  This product had zero affect on our dogs' barking.  I'm going to return it
0	I wouldn't know. My Krups FME1-14 12-Cup Coffeemaker developed a terminal leak after 2 months, so it was too late to return it or the 4 extra filters I'd bought for it.  I do hate wasting money
0	not as pictured. I personally am not happy at all with this item, very small not the same as pictured ( the one I got is bright yellow, really flimsy ) don't think it'll last very long. I'll keep it, not worth sending back, my Corgi seems to like it ~ but its a bit small even for her, I think it's life will be short. (not well made
0	Not good quality. I followed the instructions carefully, washed only in cold water, tumble dry extra low, etc. but these sheets still shrank. Also terrible pilling after only a few months. I do not recommend. The sheets were wrinkly, but I could live with that, but not the pilling, which makes them uncomfortable to sleep on
0	Oxo finally messes up. I've bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories, and found them to be sturdy, remarkably well designed, and easy to use.Unfortunately, this timer is an exception.It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer, ten number keys for input, memory, etc. But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers, it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. It's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom.The problem is the display. It's horrible. For three reasons:First, the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer I've seen. They're about 1/4" high, half or less the size of those on comparable timers.Second, the numbers are recessed 1/8" or more beneath a clear plastic cover, not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. It desperately needs a backlight, but there is none. Unless the light source is shining directly into the display, there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. But that causes the third problem:The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective, and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes .The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer, the light source, and myself into a position where I can read the small, dark, shadowed, and reflective display. Not what I need when I'm trying to cook.It's just not worth it. Since I have several other timers with displays I don't have to strain to read, I use this one as a paperweight. I'd have to say it works very well.I just don't understand how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door
0	BEAUTIFUL PRINTS OF THOMAS & FRIENDS BUT MATERIAL SANDPAPER!!. the fitted twin sheet when I used in my boy bed on corner to rip.....is the worse material use for childrens is SANDPAPER .The worse product...the only good thing is that my little sleep better with thomas and friends.I recommend thi sproduct only if your boy  is not easy to put it in bed....with thomas can sleep without mom or dad
0	Broken glass. The first time I purchased this it came with 3 glasses broken. They quickly sent me another box. Well, in this, my second shipment, 4 glasses were broken. They need to write fragile or something on the box because the post man just throws it on the doorstep
0	Save Your Money. I have owned a Misto for a while and, as others have, I noticed the way the quality of the spray deteriorated over time so that you would only get a stream of oil, instead of a mist. Well, this morning, my Misto exploded while I was using it to make pancakes (periodically spraying the pan during the process). Luckily, no one was hurt, but there is a dent in my kitchen ceiling where the top hit it, upon being expelled from the base with great force. I would estimate the BANG that accompanied the explosion was 85-90 decibels. I will definitely not buy another Misto based on today's explosion, but even before this, I was rather ho-hum about the product anyway. My advice: save your money
0	Bad dimensions. It doesn't fit my tub and is too short. I thought it would be standard width/height, but I guess I was wrong
0	flip it vacuum. The flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did I know thatI would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop.  When using the wet mop-it will leave water lines where I stop, therefore I have to wipe up the floor with paper towels. When using the vacuum myliquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks!I have not recommended this product to anyone. A waste of $100.00
0	Not As Advertised. I bought this product to replace one that had broken that I really liked. I had to return this product THREE times because it does NOT (as it says in the description) come with the perfect pour carafe which is what I wanted since the standard carafe drips EVERYWHERE. On the third time of returning it, I asked why they kept sending me the wrong carafe and they said that the perfect pour was discontinued in this size. I then mentioned to Amazon that they might want to remove that part of the description, but they have not
0	DANGEROUS!!. This toaster oven's timer is faulty - we were making toast, next thing we knew there was smoke bellowing out from it and the toast itself was on fire!!!  With today's technology Oster should take more care in providing a toaster oven with an accurate timer.  This oven almost started a house fire.  I would not recommend this oven to anyone
0	A fan from Mexico. I always buy products from amazon and I never have any complains about any of them. But about this product, I am so disappoint because the lids does'nt fit with the 32 oz. containers. I hope that they fix this problem because is a good way to keep your kitchen organized
0	Disappointing. I purchased this item after doing a lot of research on AV storage units.  I decided at the end of the day that the size and look of this one was the way I wanted to go.  I received the unit and put the shelves in the way I wanted.  The main problem with this unit, as I soon discovered is that the doors can't really hold any amount of weight.  Even after I switched off the CD's I had in the doors to half CD half DVD, they still are crooked and off kilter.  The weight of the disks causes the doors to scrape the base and not line up correctly when closed.  This makes the unit nearly useless in my opinion, unless you want to make the doors all DVD.  I hate the way it looks damaged and sloppy.  I am kicking myself for choosing this item for pure aesthetics.  I merely assumed I was getting quality as well due to the price for this size unit, but that was not the case.  I wouldn't buy or reccomend this product unless you have low expectations and can't do with any other look for your decor.
0	Misleading. I am looking for a remote trainer for one of my dogs. Amazon's listing says this Innotek trainer comes with a "lifetime warranty." I've read that batteries can be an issue with remote training collars, so I decided to review the owner's manual to learn more about the warranty.[...]The last page has a section entitled "Lifetime Limited Warranty," which states ". . . INNOTEK brand products will be free from defects in material and workmanship, under normal use, for a period of one year from the date of the original retail purchase."The "lifetime warranty" apparently expires after one year!Further on it says, the company "offers several product exchange options during the warranty period. . . . Costs are dependent on the processing time."This suggests customers will incur fees for warranty repairs even during the one year "lifetime" warranty.The next paragraph says "After one year from date of original retail purchase, we will repair, replace or upgrade your product at afixed rate based on the component."What will these repairs cost?This leaves me with a big question mark about buying a collar from Innotek.  What, if anything, is warranted for a "lifetime?"  If the lifetime warranty is really only for one year, why call it "lifetime?" And finally, what will repairs cost, both during warranty under their "product exchange options" and afterwards under their component-based "fixed rate?"My specific concern is that the collar contains a rechargeable battery. The manual does not indicate that this battery is user-replaceable. Does this mean the user will have to send the collar to Innotek to replace the battery and, if so, what will it cost?I have contacted Innotek through their website and will report back if I get a response. Until I do, I've got to rate this product with only one star because of the warranty.Can anyone comment on warranty claims to Innotek
0	What a Pain. The machine is tempremental at best - it would not use my preferred pre-ground expresso.  But is worked ok with ground beans a bit more course.  Then, I broke my glass coffee carafe - my fault, I'll buy a replacement ($24). Replacements do not come with lids.  As the lid was attached to the broken glass, I had thrown it away.  Krups will sell a replacement lid ($6, for a total of $30), but won't have it in for a month or so.  Machine does not work without the lid.  I have used Krups machines for 15+ years - never again.  My $30 is going towards a new Mr. Coffee
0	Cute but no tools. As the title says, this is a super cute vacuum cleaner with a comfortable right-angled handle but it has only a floor cleaning tool and a crevice tool--no tools for cleaning upholstery or curtains. Why on earth not? I'm having to return it because with dogs, I really need those features
0	feels like paper. This pillow cover is terrible.  It is not made out of fabric but out of paper.  It is unusable unless you like rolling over and feeling/hearing the crinkle of paper
0	Capresso 114. I have had this machine for about 2 years. I quit using it for a long time because it is almost impossible to get the right grind. The coffee just drips one drip at a time. I have tried my own burr grinder and had 3 coffee shops grind it from a #5 settin to a #8 and nothng works.I started using it again and I found that it will work it I use factory ground Starbucks, but I can't find decaff pre ground. I just ordered a different brand machine and I will junk this one.It has never worked right. I have spent hours experimenting and calling the factory. The want $60 to check it out, but I will put that toward a different machine
0	metal flakes in your ice cream. This product is very sturdy and seems to be well built, but I wound up returning it for a refund.  Each time I used it, the gearbox above the ice cream container ground LOTS of metal flakes into my ice cream.  I have read reviews of this machine since I returned it that say the same thing.  It is a neat looking product that freezes ice cream well, but unless you like to eat chunks of metal with your ice cream, I would find another machine

0	Absolute piece of expensive JUNK!. I bought one thinking the larger size and villaware name would yield great results. I presently use 2 small cuisinarts to pump out enough waffles to keep the masses happy. I cannot tell you strongly enough what an utter failure this maker is. Just like the previous reviewer, I had it on high for several minutes and the lower parts ended up dry and burnt and the upper uncooked. Uneven, slow and way too underpowered. The top sits down unevenly and the weight allows for little flexibility in top rising. It is a shame as the manufacturing and materials seems to be very high quality, but the design is horrid. Proof is in the pudding, and after 8 minutes in this thing at high, the waffles still looked like pudding. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!
0	far too expensive for the quality. I must agree with the negative reviewers that this pan's nonstick coating began coming off almost immediately after I began using it.  I'm not talking about scratches, which often are a result of using the wrong kind of implements for cooking and cleaning.  My pan began pock all over, even up the sides where I rarely touch them.  I hung on to this pan for 3 years, simply because I could not bear to part with it for the expense.  But eventually I had to treat it like my other All-Clad pans (which I LOVE) and use full amounts of oil to cook.  It was no longer worth using.Although the reviewer who loves this pan was "certain" the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly, that "certainty" is based on nothing but speculation.  I cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by All-Clad.  Of course, I could have asked All-Clad to replace it early on, since it was clear the nonstick coating was coming off on its own accord.  But that would not have changed the fact that the coating on my pan was coming off
0	A much better product when it was made in Germany. The Chinese version of this kettle is lighter and more flimsy - true, it is cheaper, but sometimes you just don't want cheap.  We had a German one that lasted 10 years - and is still being used by by wife in her office.  The one we recently got just is not the same item.  Bo! on Chef's Choice
0	deni ice crusher review. I use crushed ice when I have medical problems. I have'nt had any since I purchased the unit. Therefore I have nothing to report.
0	Not worth it. I own 3 coffee presses, all made by BonJour and I love 2 of them. This one is made with lexan, plastic plunger and a rubber O ring. There is always lots of floating coffee bits to many too scoop out and too many to ignor. Don't get it, but a glass one
0	Knobs too big for some mugs. Be sure you are planning to use this mug tree with large-handled mugs. Small mugs, like those that come with dinnerware sets, may not fit over the knobs on the ends of the arms. Also, two of the arms did not screw in properly
0	Don't do it. Listen to everyone on this website. I almost threw this coffee maker across my living on more than one occasion due to it's extremely poor design.  Mr. Coffee really struck out on this one considering they are a company that only makes coffemakers.  First of all, the water filter device failed after a few uses and would no longer allow water to flow freely through it.  This could have been due to the hardness of the tap water in my area but regardless, it's a filter, it's supposed to be able to be subjected to not so perfect water.  So before i figured out the filter wasnt allowing water to flow I would let it brew and the water would never make it out of the resovoir and would basically just steam up and evaporate.  After the entire brewing cycle I would pull the carafe out and there would be NO coffee in the carafe.  After realizing it was the filter that was causing problems i just simply removed it and didnt use it.  The coffee maker worked for a few days but only if you place the paper coffee filter in perfectly.  Otherwise, the dripping water would cause the filter to collapse and then the grains would run out of the filter, clogging the drain and then voila, you get an overflowed grain basket with dirty, grainy water all over your counters.I do not recommend this coffee maker for any reason.  Get the hamilton beach Stay or Go 45234
0	Great Item, but can't find it anywhere. The water filter for the Braun Flavorselect 12 cup coffee maker Model KF187 is a great design.  I rate it #5 for it's design, but since my original purchase of the coffee maker, I can't find the filter units anywhere
0	Garbage. I can't get mine to even pierce the can, takes 10 minutes of fiddling around to get it to pierce the can and then maybe it will open it half way.  Save your money
0	save your money!. I bought this item based on price, how can you go wrong for 10$ for a programable coffee maker? Well, you get what you pay for. after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks, it just stopped working! Just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item! based on the rest of the reviews, I just threw away and went out and bought a mr. coffee. lesson learned.treehous
0	Don't even try. I bought this hand mixer based on the quality implied by the Cuisinart name -- I had had their processor for over 20 years.  Huge mistake.  Cuisinart's quality has gone downhill in those 20 years.  This mixer lasted barely a year, diving downward the entire year but not so far as to call in a warrenty claim.  (Besides, I had had to deal with Cuisinart's so-called customer service in getting a worn-down part for the food processor, and didn't have the heart to try that again.  They berate you for "misusing" their products -- even if you're not complaining and it is only a wear issue.  Weird.)  Anyway, this mixer is done for.  It was never able to handle cookie dough, so I never asked it to after a couple of tries.  They offer a dough hook, but that's fiction.  Don't buy it.  Don't try it. Walk the other way.  (PS:  I was so blinded I thought it was just me and not Cuisinart, and replaced the old, worn food processor a few months ago with a new Cuisinart.  Anyway, the new supposedly equivalent processor is a total bust.  Very weak.  I can't believe it.  So Cuisinart has dropped off my list of reliable companies.  Too bad.  That old processor was really good for 20 years of hard use.
0	Arrived Heavily Damaged. I ordered the bench, the armchair and the coffee table.  The armchair arrived damaged, and the bench arrived so damaged, I couldn't use it.  Beware, you can't return these items to the store; I have to ship the bench back in a heavily damaged box at my own expense as USPS won't take the box it came in.
0	Poor Choice for a Steamer. The way this Steamer was advertised, I really thought it gave out alot of steam, and lasted a decent amount of time.  I tried it a few times and was very disappointed. I returned the item
0	not good for an airedale. I recently purchased the clipper--but after arrival discovered it is not designed to use on an Airedale's wire coat...The clipper went through aboout a six inch swatch and wouldn't go through any more. The motor worked okay but it doesn't cut her hair
0	poorly designed electrical contacts. I used to love this kettle.  I've had this kettle for over four years now and it has developed the same problem as some of the people who gave it one-star reviews.  The electrical contacts have degraded over the past few months and today I couldn't get it to turn on at all no matter how many times I twisted it around on its base.I've cleaned the contacts twice in the past few months to no avail.  Maybe an improvement for all of a day each time.Looking inside the base, I can see why the contacts die -- they don't grip the metal ring & spike at all, but rather the ring and spike just rest on loosely sprung metal.  Wish I'd thought to inspect that before buying it.There's no excuse for such a bad design.  Were they hoping for a repeat buy?  Not going to happen
0	Big Mistake. This was one of the worst purchases I've ever made.  The problem that I had with mine is the litter pouring out all over the place.  Everytime I went to flip the thing over, the litter came out of the cracks.  Everytime that I went to take out the little drawer that is supposed to hold the waste, more litter came out.  I ended up using it just as a regular litter box.  It was a complete disaster if I tried to use it otherwise.  Plus, the opening of the litter box is so low, that everytime the cat goes in and out, even more litter comes out of it.  I'm getting ready to throw it in the garbage once and for all, but I must admit I've never had any satisfaction from it
0	I'm a sucker but bought a replacement carafe anyway. All I can say is, the new carafe hasnt exploded yet. What I originally thought was a freak occurance is obviously a serious product design problem. (Why is the inside made of glass?)My original carafe lasted about a year and then randomly exploded during cleaning. I think I put cooler water in the carafe after it recently had hot coffee in it. From reading the other reviews, this is a common issue but I bought another one anyway!

0	Not worth it at ALL. I'm a HUGE All-Clad fan and I thought that this would be the best splatter screen out there.  I was VERY wrong.  This lets so much grease through it's joke.  Sure, it's not as bad as using nothing, but my entire stove is still covered with grease...and the design is very annoying, too.  You can't store it up against the inside wall of a cabinet because of the handle design (which also is dangerous BTW - to lift it off a pan you have to grab it right over the pan - as opposed to a handle extending out - with grease splattering everywhere and steam and heat coming right out.  Plus the handle gets EXTREMELY hot as a result of this design, as well as it's over the same heat as your food.  PLEASE save yourself $$$ and cleaning time and find a screen with smaller holes
0	It failed to work for me. A collegue of mine raved about it--she has several of the smaller model in her home and brought one in the office.  I tried it for a day, but was not convinced either way.  Then, I bought the largest model, and tried it at home.  I used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the "acid test".  I used it in the toilet room, closed the door, and let it sit there for 8 hours.  When I inspected the room, I could still smell what I smelled 8 hours earlier. And I so wanted it to work!  The other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose, but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor (as does a HEPA air filter)
0	Keyboard Drawer Inadequate. While very attractive this desk suffers from what so many inexpensive computer desks do an inadequately sized keyboard drawer.   There is enough room for the keyboard but not enough for a mouse.  This results in forcing you to have to reach forward to use the mouse on the top of the desk. I ultimately decided just put he keyboard on top the desk and raise up my chair.  The manufacturer should consider eliminating one of the drawers and extending the keyboard shelf
0	The plastic stinks. This brand new kettle - after having been cleaned, descaled with vinegar  (at Proctor Silex's suggestion), filled with a solution of water and baking soda (at Proctor-Silex's suggestion) reeks of a chemical, plastic smell, which it imparts to any water boiled in it.We're returning it immediately. Feh
0	Defective Control Master Heat Control. I bought this frying pan as a gift for my Mother and had it shipped to California where she is taking care of my 99 year old grandfather. The packaging and papers were accidently thrown away. She tried to use the pan for a roast on Jan. 12th. and set the dial to 220 to roast slowly.  When she checked it in a short time, the water was boiling rapidly and could not be reduced to a simmer. No matter what setting, it just plain got scortching hot.There is supposed to be a one year warranty, but Amazon only takes returns in the first 30 days and in original packing. I tried to contact them but can find no contact information on the web. Someone should replace the defective part, but I don't know how to accomplish this
0	R.I.P. I bought this kettle in February 2006. I liked everything about it until its automatic ON-OFF switch died recently - only two months after the purchase. Now the kettle won't turn on. It wasn't abused in any way, and these kettles usually last for years and years. The last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new Proctor Silex K4070.I wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique? Has anyone else had one with a short-lived switch, or was I unlucky?
0	CatGenie-Self Washing, Self Flushing Cat Box. It is a great concept, but mine kept filling with water and then getting an error so my cats never had a chance to use it.  I tried all of the stuff to get the errors to stop but i never had it go a whole cycle without getting an error.  I would definately be worth the money if it would work correctly
0	Microwave for RV. Our microwave went out and this was the replacement. It is just what we wanted and needed. The company was excellent to deal with
0	Very Difficult and Unpleasant To Use!. I bought it because the price was right, but this juicer is definitely wrong.  I lack the upper-body strength of a weight-lifter (which is required to turn the crank) and the patience it takes to produce any juice at all.  It makes a terrible mess and is annoying to assemble and disassemble.  I WANT A REFUND (AND SOME BAND-AIDS, PLEASE)
0	Disappointing dishrack. This dishrack looks much nicer than most you'd see in stores but the quality is not as good as it should be for the price.  The main part of the rack is very similar to wire cake-cooling racks, not very substantial, and the tray underneath is not slanted for water runoff as most dishrack drainers are.In addition to this disappointment, it was delivered in a huge box that looked as if it had been handled by Ace Ventura.  The single rack had banged around in the box that could have accommodated 15 racks, and as a result the stainless steel tray was slightly dented.  Very weird!
0	Flawed design. I have watched Emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter.  I just dismissed it as part of Emeril's shtick until I bought this machine for myself.  The first time I tried to use it with any liquid ingredients (making mayonnaise), it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl.  The top is just flawed in its design, as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl.  I suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that KA did, much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews (e. g. Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated).In any case, this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry (they blow through the badly designed joint as well) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter, the outside of the bowl, the bottom of the machine, and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do.  I will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the Cuisinart I have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard.
0	A Bad Buy. After 6 months of use, the LED switch popped out of the coffeemaker's base, which turned the wired plug into an on/off device. I found that Black & Decker no longer services these products and the firm that does doesn't respond to e-mail
0	YUCK. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers about the smell of this cleaner...it almost made me lose my lunch.  Disgusting, UGH.  I suggest anyone who cannot stand this smell to use the Bissell formulations, either the Wood Floor Solutions or Hard Floor Solutions.  They have a pleasant, fresh, clean scent
0	Handle won't even move!. I started by lifting the handle to open the machine. I then tried closing it again without anything inside, just to see how it worked. I couldn't push the handle back down. A little frustrated, I thought that perhaps it was a safety device that wouldn't allow you to trap your fingers, so I grabbed a potato to experiment with. Unfortunately, unless you use baby potatoes, they don't fit into the machine anyway. I find it hard to understand how this item can be called a "potato cutter", when it doesn't. I tried all sorts of things in the cutter and nothing would allow me to push the handle back down. I finally used a screwdriver to lever the contraption shut, just to enable me to put it back in the box for a full refund
0	Product does not work well. I had high hopes for these space bags.  I bought several in advance of our cross-country move.  I think two of them worked, as in, stayed sealed and compressed.  The rest would not stay sealed, no matter what we did.  I would not buy these again.  I wish I had saved the money
0	Bad Unit. Wish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this. I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years.  After it got the new plastic taste out of it, it made good coffee. Even without the Brita Filter.  Just like all the reviewers indicated, the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully.  Unfortunately, it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months.  The seller, Etronics, is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period.  That will be the last thing I buy through them.  Like uhh, since they sell Braun,one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers.  So, here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place,  try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced, or just bite the bullet an go buy another. (want to bet it won't be a Braun?) Additionally, what do we do for coffee in the mean time?  Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet
0	I wish I were better at returning things. 1. no attachment-so, you can clean a 1 inch circle at once (how convenient is that?)2. It is heavy and smooth and cone shape!  This does not make for a comfortable, secure grip (the other kinds a toddler could use)  I don't get the good reviews!!!!!!!!good for ... cracks in car seat
0	SAVE YOUR MONEY. I have owned this litter box, I'd say about 3 months now. I have to tell you, this is such a cool concept! However, I would be happier had I just set my money on FIRE. I'd sure be a lot less stressed at least.The first few days, it worked fine. I was so excited. My cats suprisingly used it, and I had no problems at all. I thought I was in heaven. But such is life, all good things must come to an end. It started erroring.. EVERYTIME I used it. Sometimes... for no reason. It would all finished drying the granules and everything would be dandy and BEEP BEEP BEEP.. so then I'd hit the button, and it would start all over again!! To be honest, I think this is a built in scam just so it uses more of that solution and you have to buy more... which btw, I'm pretty certain that solution is nothing more than a gimmick so they can get more of your money. The 300+ bucks just wasn't enough.But anyways. Back to the errors. It would error every time I used it. EVERY time. And it would always be a different error. I'd fix it (which btw, it drains like CRAP)... and then go on about my day. Well one day, I forgot it was running and went over to my neighbors. I was there about... 2 hours ish. When I walked outside her door, to my annoyance, I could of course, hear my "so awesome" cat genie... beeping in error. And to my even WORSE annoyance, apparently the long term beeping kept 2 of my 3 cats, from ever wanted to go near it again. So 1 of them kept trying to go outside to use the bathroom... and she's not an outdoor cat... and the other one just took it upon herself to pop a squat wherever she felt comfortable.Now fast forward about 4 days ago. My cat genie just STOPPED draining. Altogether. Stopped. I walked in and saw that it was about to overflow.. (the one time it doesn't give me an error beep!!) so I frantically turned it off and tried to fix it. It didn't work. I tried again... and tried for about an hour when finally, I accepted defeat and took it apart... and dumped the water. Most of it got on my floor.. which I was ecstatic about since that's what I was trying to prevent in the first place... went to my computer... and e-mailed the company. That was about 4 days ago... and I've not heard back from them since.So I assume they're realizing what a huge peice of crap they're selling and hopefully they either fix said peice of crap, or stop selling it altogether..... because I'm not happy that I spent so much money, on such a huge worthless peice of junk.Like I said, it's a cool concept...... but it just plain doesn't work. And for the people on here that it DID work for... Congrats. But 300+ bucks is too much of a gamble for something that just "might not work".Stick to the regular old litter box for now. That's where I'm back to..
0	Didn't work for me. This thermometer just didn't work.  I ruined a batch of carmel because the gage wouldn't rise above 220.  I don't know if I just got a "bad" one, but I'm not going to find out by exchanging it.  When I return it, I'm getting a different, more trusted brand.

0	Very Disappointed. This lamp would be gorgeous if it was made as described - there is nothing bronzelike about it - it is PAINTED a dark yuck brown. Three very obvious sections make up the pole - it reminds me of an old pole lamp!  The &quot;textured&quot; part is occasional comblike scratches in the metal before it was painted the yuck brown. It is a sleazy knock-off of what was probably a high style lamp
0	Returned asap very poor quality disappointed!. I ordered two of these in King very disappointed very poor quality item cotton is very hard seams coming apart every where loose threading returned asap The abigail quilt I purchased from amazon was excellent.
0	Form over function. The machine looks great. It sat nicely on our counter-top next to the Kitchen Aid mixer and looked really classy. If that was all I wanted to do with it, then I would have been very happy with it, but I actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos.Firstly, I found the steamer wand to be awkward to use. It rotates, but has little movement up or down. As a result, I found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter-top when I was finished. It produced good foam though.Secondly, the indicator lights are so dim I found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not.Finally the espressos I made had no crema at all. I have been making them for 3 years with our current Saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one. After pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder. The machine was constantly leaking water & steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere.In summary: If you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter, buy this machine. If you want to make decent espresso-based drinks, don't
0	Not for dogs that like to chew. I bought this toy from a local Petsmart for my 2 yr. old Boxer.  He had this toy chewed up within 20 minutes.

0	As much work as ironing. For the price, it IS amazing that this steamer does anything, which accounts for all the rave reviews.  This little number is not real powerful, so you don't get the effortless, quick steamer results that most of us seek.  The steam output is low, so you go over and over the garment, with little improvement.  Forget about using it on linen.  Even on thin cotton, it creates tiny spider wrinkles.  You have to hold the hose vertically to prevent water from spurting, which is awkward and dangerous, as the hose gets HOT.  You have to have a door near an electrical outlet.  Then the hook doesn't fit over the thickness of the door, nor does the hose reach the item hanging from it.  It is as much work as ironing, but with ironing, you can eventually achieve the desired result.  The steamer is compact, heats quickly and doesn't take up much room.  I returned mine, but there may be a few people who like this steamer

Needless to say, after about 2  hours of use, the item just stopped working.  I beleive it had something to do with the cheap button used to turn the product on.  Yes, it was a cheap toy to buy price wise, but I guess I got what I paid for

0	Not Happy. It seems everyone loves this wok, but I didn't have a very good experience with it.  I have cleaned and seasoned carbon steel pans in the past, so I know how to do it.  But, the factory coating that came on this one was impossible to remove completely.  I thought I had it cleaned off, after following the directions and scrubbing and scrubbing.  However, the first time I cooked with it, the places where it simply wouldn't come off burned and turned sticky.  I ended up giving it away
0	Can't Get Grooves Clean. I did not buy the whole set. My review is for an 8" fry pan. It was one of those "try it" deals. I do not like the grooves in the pan because after, for instance, frying an egg, the grooves retain food and if you don't use a brush to scrub the grooves you'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves. I can't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware. Yikes
0	to be a fry pan in our house is a true test of any cookware. that said, the All-Clad Stainless 14-Inch Nonstick Fry Pan has clearly failed. the non-stick surface began to deteriorate long before any other non-stick pan we've owned has in the past.we received this pan as part of 10-peice set, and really, it's the only complaint we have about the set in general. the rest of the All-Clad pieces have performed beautifully and withstood all of the rigors of being cookware in a house with two accomplished and passionate chefs.about a year ago we gave up on this pan and purchased the 'Restaurant Fry Pan Set' from Nordic Ware (8" and 10") and they have performed much better than the All-Clad version of the same and held there non-stick surface now four times as long -- at a fraction of the cost! unfortunately this set is not currently available on amazon.Note: I should point out, in response to the "weekend" chef who gave this pan five stars, that both my wife and I are well versed in the care of non-stick pans (plastic and wooden utensils only, let them cool before you wash them, etc.) and the surface still deteriorated. I'm sticking to my guns, (no pun intended) these two other non-stick fry pans have now lasted over four years without a hitch. the All-Clad lasted only six-months with the same love and care
0	Looks nice... uneven toaster. This is a stylish toaster.  Have you tried finding a decent toaster lately?  I've been through many.  If you like crispy dark toast, this is it - but if you like browned toast, this is uneven and burns one end, and light on the other.  This is the second one of these I had.  The first was bad and so the customer service (which is very good) sent me a replacement.  It's just as bad.  Used to be any cheapo toaster would do a great job.  It's much harder to find one now.  If you look inside when the elements are going, many of the windings of the heating elements are too tight and so don't heat up since they are flush against the insulation so only around 1/2 of the inner elements even glow red, but the outer ones are better, so it's very uneven.  Good luck

0	problems with Bulters Pantry dishes. I received a 12-piece placesetting of these dishes for our wedding. After using the dishes for about six months, cracks have appeared in the glazing and edges have chipped/flaked off bowls and plates. The dishes have not been used extensively, and it appears that even light "everyday" use by two people is too much for them. Lenox recommends using low temperature dishwasher setting and low temperature microwave use. Even following those instructions, our dishes have cracked and chipped. When I called Lenox to complain, they told me they would have to send a formal letter of authroization, at which time I would be asked to mail them the damaged dishes (10 dinner plates, nine bowls and one salad plate). One of their quality control specialists would examine the dishes and call me back I would not recommend this line from Lenox. I am awaiting the authorization letter, but overall, I am very disappointed in this product and the company that buit its reputation on quality and high standards. I would not recommend these dishes.
0	Takes too long. I haven't had much success with this ice cream maker.  I usually give up after 2 hours of churning, and the mixture is far from ice cream at that point.  I usually have to throw it all in my freezer to get it to solidify into something resembling ice cream.  I saw in another review that it has taken another user 2.5-4 hrs to make ice cream.  That's way too long...seems like the old hand crank ice cream maker my parents used to use was a lot quicker

The slicer worked good at first and I was pleased, but after 5 1/2 months, I started to have problems with it. The machine started to make noises and the blade would stop spinning. Come to find out, that the gears ( located underneath the blade ) are made out of plastic and the wore out. So if you need this slicer for cutting bread like I do, it's no good.Now I'm on the search for a slicer that has gears out of metal, but it seems like there is none. I've contacted Deni and Waring and their gears are made out of plastic as well. So if anyone out there has a slicer that has metal gears or has a slicer that has lasted more than 1 year in constant use, please let me know. I need a good one for a decent price.
0	Dissapointed DeLonghi customer. Decided to buy the DeLonghi heater, as recommended by ConsumerReports.  On being powered on, the unit oscillated but neither fan nor heater started up.  I did make sure the 'safety trip' was not activated.  This is located below the unit, designed to switch it off in case it toppled over.  In short, I put in the effort, to make sure I wasn't doing anything stupid, since the unit 'looked' fine - nothing obviously broken.A prior reviewer seems to have had similar problem, but thought Amazon's package handling might be the culprit.  In my case, the packaging on arrival was excellent.Return procedure for Amazon was surprisingly smooth, they even refunded the shipping fee for sending it back.
0	Not air tight. These containers are a great size and hold exactly what they say they will and save cabinet space.  Unfortunatly my sugar clumped up because of moisture and bugs got into my flour..  I'd suggest Snapware instead..
0	I sent this knife back. This knife was dull upon receipt.  I sent it back...although I loved the handle shape and color
0	Good and Bad. I added this Henkels International 5 piece Scissors when I purchased Henkels Pro-S 8inch High Carbon Chef's knife. The price for this 5 piece package was great considering the name value of Henkels. However, the quality of product was not even close to the same scissor I purchased 8 years ago, and surprisingly, within 2 weeks they are getting rusty on hinges.Well --- what you are paying for is what you are going to get
0	Exquisite product -as long as you don't intend to use it. This stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream - built with quality materials like real metal (not silvery plastic), and sporting a sophisticated, drop-dead gorgeous retro appeal.  It looks equally as impressive in the hippest New York loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of Williams-Sonoma.However, as is the case when function follows form, this is a horrible blender.  Don't get me wrong - I'm more than willing to forgive a modicum of piss-poor functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant.  But quite frankly, this blender is beyond bad.Most unfortunate is the blender's propensity to splash everywhere - even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand.  It seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing; it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor.  I suspect that the unit's quasi-industrial motor may be a contributing factor; it only supports two speeds: off, and jet-cyclonic.  While I admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right, the consequences of omitting ramp-up speeds are overbearing, consistently messy, predictably inconvenient, and potentially dangerous (as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing).  The irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward; and the blender's poorly-sealed lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion.  In fact, this blender splashes so profusely that it's nearly unusable.It's too bad, because superficially, this blender really is quite the objet d'art.  But when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance, it has a long way to go - even in comparison to a $29 Oster.If I had to summarize this blender as accurately, succinctly, and fairly as possible, I'd distill it down to one word - "regrettable."
0	Not so great... I have had this sweeper for several months and like others, it's main purpose was to keep my kitchen floor, laundry room, and basement floors clean. Well, it does pick up larger debris best, but when you go for picking up hair, dust and dirt, it blows a lot of it around, not to mention, I noticed that the entire sweeper itself becomes COVERED in dust. Don't buy this sweeper if tou expect it to "suck" things up. It provides NO suction but a motorized brush roll that spins and rolls things up into the dust cup. I recommend this for occasional use for spills like cereal, rice, etc. As far as being a tool to "clean" your floors, you will be quite disappointed. In fact I only use this now to clean my laundry room area and basement floors to pick up debris so it doesn't get tracked in my upstairs
0	A Great Big Mess all over my Stove and Kitchen floor. We used this fryer a few times and never quite got the food to come out as crispy as we wanted. We attributed that to a learning curve about what oil to use and also the fact the we had never used fryers before.A couple things we were willing to put up with that could be improved were:1. The light turns off when the temperature is reached (wouldn't it be better to have the light go on when the temperature is reached?)2. The light is in a bad viewing position all the way towards the back of the fryer behind a big knob, so unless you're very tall, you have to tippy toe up to look down on it to see when the light is off. We are 5'6" and 5'9"--3. There is not a digital read-out of the current temperature of the oil.But all those points became moot the other day when I made fries. While the fries were enjoyable enough (even though they were a bit soggy) after letting the oil cool in the fryer, I started draining it with the automatic filtration system. I was impressed with the functionality of the drainage system as I watched the oil drain into the bottom tray.Then I got about my other business in the kitchen.Several minutes later I looked over and the oil had leaked all over my stove and floor!!! There must have been at least two cups of oil that seeped all over my stove (luckily not my burners since I have a very wide older electric stove with a space large enough to hold the fryer.) What a @@@@@@@ mess. That kind of disaster does not warrant another chance in my opinion.I'm sending it back
0	can openers should be easy. i bought this can opener to replace a lessexpensive hamilton beach model that stopped working.  i needed a black one so i took a chance on the same brand, better model.  well, i was wrong.  the can opener never works on the first try.  i have to fiddle around with can placement to get it to work.  it tears and bunches up the label under its cutting blade, it whirrs away, but cut nothing 90% of the.  i feel lucky whenever i get a can opened and down right incredulous if it works on the first try.  do not buy this product.  if i hadn't optmistically thrown out the box, i would have returned it
0	not as good as the first one I owned. I bought my first Presto Power Pop many, many years ago. I  loved it. Finally, after so many years of use the plastic bowl developed cracks on the bottom. So I ordered a new one. The concentrator base on this new one scorches holes in the paper concentrators after only 2 uses ( with the old popper I could reuse about  12 times.
0	Cat collar. The idea is good, but the collar too easily slipped off our cat's neck
0	Holmes HM630-U Tower Humidifier. I'm not happy.  The filter needed changing one day out of the box.  We have soft water so this should have lasted a while.  Difficult to hang on to when filling, have to hold it like a baby.  Does put out the air though and fits about anywhere
0	NOT Pottery Barn!. If what you're looking for is lush, plush truly thick towels, these are NOT it. If you want Pottery Barn luxe, you'll have to go there. These are a poor substitute. I could not have been more disappointed. I returned them all.
0	Pleasant Enough. I Purchased a set simply because they came close in design to our everyday flatware.  They come in a nice pine box which has no lid so they do take up space on a drawer or shelf.  The knives themselves are very light weight.  Our set (black and steel) was fine with no obvious flaws.  The handles are lightweight plastic and the rivets are small so there is a question of how long they will hold up. They would have done better to use resin impregnated wood.  The tang does go the length of the grip.  These seem as sharp as any steak knives I have used and are quite comfortable in the hand and do afford good control when triming a steak or a chop close to the bone!  I would say they are of the same level of quality that you might find at a  Woolworths (of sainted memory!) or a K-Mart.  Not something to buy if you are really looking to even come close to the traditional high quality of either Sabatier or Laguiole.  That said I am planning on buying a second set to match the number of place settings of our everyday flatware
0	Very Puzzled & Disappointed. I purchased this item as a filler. I have two steamers already that are 5+ yrs old. First of all i found this item to be smaller than i expected. Secondly, i washed this item as instructed and left it out to air dry (as i do with my others without any problems), on the second day i noticed some dark blemishes on the underside. These eventually turned into numberous dark spots on the underside on both basket parts of the steamer. I have never experienced this before! They were deep into the bamboo, this item had just been steamed then washed in very hot water and allowed to air dry... i have no idea how this happened? I used one of my others at the same time and it never developed this problem. I returned the item to Amazon.
0	4 out of 5 items were defective. I really wanted to like this dining set - it looked nice in the picture and the reviews impressed me.However, when the set was put together 3 out of 4 chairs wobbled - 2 moderately and 1 really bad, the difference in leg length was almost an inch. The reason was easily identified - the connection holes in the back of the chair were drilled in a slanted line instead of horisontal. So no tightening the chairs with someone sitting on them would have helped (besides, there is just not that much leeway with metal-to-metal connections).But that was not all - one of the chairs had a warped back (paper thin warped veneer on the backside of the top). You did hear me say "veneer" - make no mistake, the set is NOT made of solid wood (the description does not claim it to be so, this is just a reminder).Compared to the above the "tiny laquer drops" defect on a small area of the table top was minor.I gave the set 2 stars only because it does look pretty good. If you want to give it a chance and are prepared to mess with getting another set to replace possibly defective items you might get good results after all. With 4 items out 5 coming defective I did not bother to test my luck again and simply returned the purchase. It took an hour of 2 people's time to put the set together and then another hour for me to take it apart and try to pack it back in the box (keep the box!) as this was the only way to return the set.
0	Don't buy refurbished. We had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out.  When I saw the refurbished for $20.00 I thought it was a great deal.  It would have been if it had come with all the parts and didn't leak!!  It didn't come with seals or with the water purifier.  I tried everything including new seals (that I bought separately).  Eventually we just went out and purchased a new one, because we still like the model.
0	I don't understand why you are still selling this product. This percolator is not worth the price.  The coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot.I returned mine and purchased the Farberware FCP512S 12-Cup Cordless Percolator.  I love it!
0	Very flimsy!. I purchased two of these and the metal is flimsy.  Both "boxes" are warped and don't sit squarely on the counter (wobble).  There's nothing I like about them!  One was missing a plastic edge piece on the door. VERY DISAPPOINTING
0	BAD FIT. I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room.  He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a "20 inch" TV.  If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!!  I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!!
0	Junk. First, the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner.  That can be overlooked, but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability.  I may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks, no matter what setting I put it on.Horrible to say the least.  I sent it back and purchased a new one, which I enjoy to this day
0	DON'T BUY-NO PARTS OR SERVICE!!!. I purchased this for my daughter, and boy is it a cute idea!!! And it even worked okay, that is for just over 1 yr. Yep, just past the limited warranty. So I called Bissell and they informed me that there are no longer parts available for this model and my only option was to BUY a new one.Well, I told them I am not likely to do that, since it only lasted a year!!! We didn't even get to use the handle extentions that come with it. What a nice addition to the landfills!!
0	Not too hot. I baked six loaves in this machine.  I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right.  My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures.  Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked.  I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe.  The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon.  Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund
0	Though beautiful, alas, mine rusted too... One shouldn't have to empty water out after every use.  One shouldn't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice.  That is not a functional teapot, if that may be the case.  Though it is the prettiest teapot around, it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while.  Le Creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime, but the enamelware can't even touch the quality of the cast-iron cookware.  Fortunately, the company stands by its products and I am sending mine back for a replacement.  See www.lecreuset.com for details..
0	Holes not as small as advertised. The add said it would seperate small berry seeds.  The holes on the smallest grate are about 1/8".  You could fit 20 seed through one of them.  Very disappointing
0	Was below-average for a while, then jammed. I received this blender for x-mas last year.  It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap).  However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes.  It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart.  While it worked OK for a while, the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months
0	My first Amazon return. A few times it worked great, but mostly it brewed uneven. I'm not being a nitpicker here... Literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim. There was no pattern to it, sometimes it was  the left one, sometimes the right one, sometimes neither. Filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging... don't mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter! It only took two days before I realized this was not worth the money or the time
0	POOR CHOICE - STEER CLEAR. I purchased two Digital KCM-515 Steel 10-Cup Coffee maker as Christmas gifts (one for myself and the other for my sister).  Both of these units turned out to be major DUDS and will be returned quicker than Santa can navigate his way back to the North Pole.PROBLEM: The coffee comes out WARM and the carafe DOES NOT retain warmth for more than 10 minutes (and that's stretching it)!  The heating plate is only warm to the touch immediately after brewing.  You have to microwave the coffee almost immediately after it is brewed.COMMENT:  The reviewer who wrote that having to pre-heat the carafe with piping hot water BEFORE brewing a pot of coffee had it right!  That should have been a clue.  I had the same "gut feeling" when I read the instructions.  In my view, a consumer shouldn't have to waste hot water to "pre-heat" a unit with a stiff sticker price!  As for the reviewer who implied that those of us who are dissappointed with this unit need to read the instuctions -- gimme a break
0	pretty awful... I bought 2 of these dispensers, one for syrup and one for honey. The dispenser is too stiff for children to use, and while the syrup moves quite freely, it takes hours for honey to pour. It makes for a sticky mess. Definitely not worth having
0	Handle breaks easily. I bought this crock pot because it didn't look like a traditional country style crock pot. Unfortunately the handle broke off with the slightest bump. You can't even buy a new liner on their parts web site. This thing is a flimsy piece of crap.
0	Do Not Buy This Product. Do not buy this product or any other product with the Perfect Pour Carafe.  The brilliant designers at Black & Decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe.  The problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over.  Nice work guys.  One call to their Customer Service line was cut off.  On the next I chose the option to leave a message and be called back--unfortunately the mailbox was full.  I guess the poor product deserves poor customer service
0	Hole in One Water Globe. Very disappointed when it broke after 15 minutes of handling.  Very thin glass edges.  Will not buy again
0	Not very happy. The carafe has a plastic insert with a strong smell. There was no instruction how to pull it out (instructions were very general, incomplete and written in not very good English). I did not get any response from the factory, so I did not have a choice and had to return it. Also, for this price the outside of the top should have been plated better
0	terrible customer service. If you want to get a migraine and be stuck without a mixer for the holidays this would be the company that you would order from. It is now january 18th and i have yet to receive the mixer or refund on the purchase of this product. i have called and called and called jr electronics and to no avail i still havent received a refund for this product
0	Go back to the cutting board. I bought the Chop Wizard thinking it would save me time in the kitchen, but it hasn't.  Food has to be prepared (destemmed, decored, sliced, etc.) before going in the device to the extent that I might as well do all the work with my knife and cutting board.  Depending on the food, cleanup can be a hassle too.  Last night, I spend ~ 2 minutes using the cleaning comb accessory to get sweet potato out of the plastic grid on the underside of the lid.  I feel guilty for adding to the waste stream with this device that in my opinion is an insult to the tried and true, fast and easy, cheap and simple knife and cutting board
0	Not worth the money. Its not light as advertised.  Its actually a very cumbersome broom.  I'd rather use a regular broom than this huge thing.  I would not recommend for every day use.  The bristles get bent due to the weight of it, and they don't sweep as well after a month or so
0	not the colors stated in the description. Yes these are beautiful dishes, however they are not grey and slate blue or two shades of grey.. they are purple!!! so when they arrived at my door I was really disappointed.. purple doesn't go with the color scheme I have... and slate blue/or grey would have done nicely!so the one star is for Amazonz inability to properly describe the item
0	Don't Bother!. Total rubbish. Wood was scratched on top, corner was smashed, water damage on the shelf, and door was cracked. It is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use. The holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together. Extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control. To add salt in the wound, the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and I had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it. If you like taking chances and do still want to buy it, it's probably a 50-50 chance that it will be damaged.
0	Find another blanket. I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way.
0	Flimsy and uncomfortable. We purchased the Lapinator Plus for $30 plus shipping, as well as the jumbo "Microbead" lap desk for half that price ($15.99).  The microbead desk has a much thicker molded plastic top; the microbead filled base pad conforms to your lap much better and is more comfortable; it's 2 inches wider, 1 inch longer, and accomodates my widescreen laptop better; and it has two pencil wells and a clip on one end so it can be used for a lap desk without the computer: Again, all for half the price of the Lapinator.  The Lapinator Plus has a flimsy, light weight piece of vinyl for a top, a stitched edge, and an uncomfortable foam base that puts my legs to sleep. Buyer beware! Check out the microbead lap desk first.
0	Like a Ferrari: a frustratingly fickle machine. I bought a Capresso 114.01 espresso machine via Amazon in December of 2005. I had selected it in part, because of the high "bar" pressure rating. Upon receiving it, the first shot of espresso took several minutes to make. The coffee just drips out one drop at a time. The manual suggests "using a coarser grind than other espresso machines". I tried progressively coarser grinds until I was at the coarsest setting of my burr gringer...the coffee was getting weaker, and coming out a little faster, but still taking many minutes for one shot of espresso, with a weak and bitter result and no crema. The manual suggests tamping the coffee ever so lightly. Good suggestion, because if you tamp it with more than a feather's weight of pressure, you get no coffee flow at all. I called Capresso technical support numerous times. They suggested disassembling the machine--unscrewing the metal screen on the body of the machine where the water comes through-- and cleaning it. I did this to no avail. Besides, one shouldn't need to service a machine that is less than a month old in this way! After two months of frustrating, hit-and-miss results, I returned the machine to Amazon. Because it's after the 30 day return period, I may not get a full refund, but I'm glad to be rid of that piece of junk. I have since purchased a $180 Krups XP 4000 espresso machine that just works beautifully, with any grind of coffee (even very fine), any tamping pressure (even quite firm), the machine produces 2 shots of espresso in 25 seconds flat with tons of crema. What a relief
0	The first time a Taylor product has disappointed me. I bought one that didn't always work, and a replacement one was even less reliable.  I upgraded to a higher priced mechanical timer from Taylor and it didn't work at all.  What can have happened to Taylor products?!
0	This one is a Dud!. I have numerous KA appliances, including the stand mixer and Food Processor.  I was happy to see a nice salad spinner, but was disappointed when I opened to use it for the first time.  The middle plunger which you are to turn counter clockwise to remove will not budge!  I tried, my husband tried and it is impossible to remove, therefore, I am unable to use the store feature since I cannot remove the plunger.  Something as simple as a salad spinner should not be so complicated
0	A BIG disappointment. I thought this pan would be multi-purpose. It is not.It is also very "tinny" and not so well made.Save your money and get a adonized pan instead
0	looks quite cheap, not as good from the picture. looks quite cheap, not as good from the pictur
0	Not all it's cracked up to be. This grater is not a convenience, it's more of a punishment.  I have tried it for hash browns, cheese, chocolate, etc.  I thought at first I was using it incorrectly, but then realized, there really is no wrong way of using this.  Everytime I have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that I would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually.  My fingers and hands ache so bad that I can't even hold a pencil after using this gadget.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Unfortunately, you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star, but in reality I give it NO STARS!
0	Good but unpredictable. I bought this coffee machine in October 2006 from Amazon after reading the reviews on this page, and I knew that some users had problems with the coffee leaking over the sides and onto the hot plate. But I figured that it was only happening to some of the customers and some of the time.This coffee maker makes great coffee and it looks good on our counter.But this coffee machine needs constant supervision because, at least in our case, it will drizzle/drool/leak over the sides and onto the hotplate and frequently in enough volume to also go over the edge of the plate and all over the counter. If we set it up to make a 6 cup pot and go off to have a shower, we frequently come back to a mess on the counter top, because at least a cup of coffee has not made it into the carafe. And as someone noted, it's impossible to figure out how to resolve the problem. We have looked at the "drip stop" mechanism in the basket, and there's nothing obvious here. We've looked at the top of the carafe and there's nothing there either. You can seat and re-seat the carafe and sometimes it will work, and and other times a disaster. Today we are simply staying in the kitchen to watch the entire pot brew, as the leaking can occur at anytime in the brewing cycle, not just at the start. I am now so annoyed that I am writing the company to tell them how annoying this is. And I buying a new coffee maker. I am not sure Amazon will allow me to return the machince, but I will try. Buy something else unless you really like troubleshooting a design that needed a bit more beta testing before it was  ready for production
0	High Defective Rate. I purchased two of these items through Amazon.  One of the units worked briefly, then quit; the other never worked at all.  Under the vendor's return policy, I returned these items (at my own expense) to the vendor for a refund and ordered two more directly from the vendor.  Only one of these additional two units worked.  That's three out of four defective--a 75% failure rate, and the buyer has to pay the return costs.  Further, this is not the first time I've had problems with "GE SmartHome" products.  An earlier purchase of other items of the same brand from another vendor also produced defective merchandise.  I would give these items ZERO "stars," if that were possible
0	BROKEN into a 1000 pieces. I rated this product a 1 star, because I was never able to see the product as it was sent to me BROKEN.Amazon has got to get with the packaging program.  I was handed the box by the delivery guy and I heard tiny shards of glass rattling around.  I opened the box to discover PATHETIC PACKAGING, no peanuts or anything just a broken crystal decanter inside of a box. HOW STUPID.  The main box didn't even have glass or fragile written on it-so I'm sure the delivery guys were anything but careful with it (for all they could tell it was a box of fluffy sheets.)However, Amazon says they will pay for my return shipping and replacement.  We'll see how this goes.  I'll keep you posted when I receive the second item.  Wish Amazon luck
0	Don't buy these!. I registered for these because Henckels has a good reputation, but i am really disappointed. The knives are not recommended for the dishwasher and I have hand washed them all. Despite this after one time of using the chopping knife and hand washing it, it has begun to rust. I wish I would have registered for the more expensive knives. In the long run it would have saved me money
0	Works, but not for long!. In principle, this should be a great product.  We got one and set it up in a few seconds.  Our dogs responded to it very well, and stopped most of their barking.  (In spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind.)  Then after less than 10 days of use, it went dead.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit.  That one worked great...for 5 days.  Then it went catatonic, with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently ON mode.  The vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund.That's 2 out of 2 units defective, which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer.  Instead of wasting your time, maybe you should look for a different manufacturer
0	Hate it. My previous coffe pot, a cheapie Black-n-Decker, developed a habit of overflowing; because the cheezy "sneak a cup" mechanism would not function properly, creating the equivalent of a flooding toilet.Well, I spent $$$ right here on Amazon to buy the Braun instead, and guess what? I now have an overpriced flooding coffee toilet.I have owned this unit for around 6 months now, and on a given day, it will..a.) produce the Flooding Coffee Toilet effect, with grounds and coffee everywhere (15% chance)b.) Leak so much coffee during brewing that what started out as a full pot ends up as an 8-cup pot with the remainder on the counter (80% chance). Careful observation indicates this is due to a badly designed "sneak a cup" feature. The coffee creates a surface tension on the base of the basket, and trickles off to the edge of the coffee maker instead of dripping into the carafe.c.) Deliver the expected pot of coffee (5% chance)[note on option b.: I keep the coffee maker on a tray, because I got tired of cleaning up after it]I will -not- buy another Braun. I should have boxed this unit up and returned it to Amazon the first week I had it. I kept saying to myself "It must be good, it was rated the best!"Well guess what? I would rate it a ZERO STAR, but the least Amazon will let me give it is a 1
0	1 star for A-. mazon. I ordered 4 for xmas dinner, was sent three and they cancelled the 4th one saying the will never get it in.  Thanks Amazon
0	Started out good, but did not last long. I'm new to making espresso and lattes, so lots of trial and error was required.  Out of the box, the machine performed well and true to other feedback, the frother worked extremely well.  The steam control knob was required to throttle steam flow to achieve micro-froth.  After using every day for 2 months, it now takes 20 minutes to make a latte and there is barely enough steam to froth.  If you're serious about making espresso, pay a little more and get a more robust unit
0	Don't waste your money!. After using this product twice I would have to say that it does not work.  You are supposed to leave the solution on for 3 minutes before washing items and I did this the 1st time, the 2nd time I left the solution on longer and I still have hard water stains and salt build up.  I honestly get a better clean from using dishsoap
0	Waste of money. This warmer will NOT keep your coffee hot.  Lukewarm is the best you can hope for and that is only when the cup is almost empty.  Don't waste your money on this.  I'm still looking for one like I used to have that actually kept the coffee steaming hot..
0	BETTER OFF WITH PAPER FILTERS. Don't buy this product.  It was ill-fitting and incompatible with the coffee maker amazon matched it up with.  I returned mine and went with paper filters, which work so much better and are cleaner
0	Can a scale be too cranky and indecisive?. I've gotten into bread baking and many of the books recommend measuring ingredients by weight instead of volume so I bought this scale.  It's very affordable and made by what I considered to be a good manufacturer.  I didn't think, though, that I would meet a scale that is so temperamental and indecisive.  I always place the scale on a level, flat surface but when I put something on it to be weighed, the readout fluctuates anywhere from tenths of an ounce to an ounce or two, going up or down and not really settling anywhere.  I have to wait a minute for the scale to make up its mind about EXACTLY how much the object weighs.I probably should have gone to a brick-and-mortar store to check out the actual design of the scale before I placed my order.  Instead of individual on/off and tare buttons, this scale has "on", "off", and "tare" marked on the front edge of the scale and you are supposed to press down on your function of choice and the edge kind of buckles down and activates hidden buttons inside the mechanism:  Bear with me here, this is weird and hard to describe!  And it doesn't work very well either.  Sometimes, pushing down on "tare" turns the scale off.  I don't know why they didn't opt for simple straightforward buttons for the functions, but there you go.The button that switches the scale between pounds/ounces to metric is on the bottom of the scale.  While it doesn't particularly bother me, one time, I did want to weigh something in one system and switch to another (too lazy to bust out the old conversion formula) and I had to remove the item, turn the scale over, flip the switch, and start the weighing process again.I think I should have returned this and bought another model that would have made me happier.  This was a lesson in buying gadgets without physically checking them out--this scale looks good on paper and has a very affordable price tag, but it's not the best digital scale out there.  More than half the time, I don't feel like dealing with this wishy washy scale so I just measure out my ingredients by volume.  Which, indeed, defeats the purpose of why I got this scale in the first place
0	black and decker food processor. Everything has to be lined up just right for the machine to turn on. Its a safety feature. I can't seem to line it up right and get frustrated. My husband doesn't have this problem. It works for him every time. He prides himself in it. I also think its lightweight and plastic. Its quality is average. If I had to purchase a food processor again, I would look for one that was strong and durable and easier to figure out that its assembly is correct before I turn it on
0	very poor quality. very bad quality, not worth to buy it.it is not as good as the picture. Don't buy it!!
0	Cheep product! Did not work!. When I put the batteries in, it did not work! I had to take it apart and solder the spring connection to the PC board.
0	Sucks great but, sucks. Giving 2 stars on the suction alone. Hepa filter doesn't self-clean/turn after one use. A lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you don't pay very close attention to aligning it just right. I really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it's heavy and dirt just falls out, a lot of dirt, when emptying the dirt box. I'm returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience
0	Horribly disappointed. This is the most I've spent on a coffee maker. It was delivered right before Christmas of '06 and broke 3 months later.  What a waste of money.It made very good coffee while it worked.  The last time I expected it to function, I was greeted with a flood on my counter and floor.  All 6 cups of water had leaked out. The 'ON' button stopped working. No doubt it somehow shorted itself out from the water.I will NEVER buy this brand again
0	real junk. Buy something else. First of all, it started out fine - had good suction, etc. There was only one flaw the dusting wand didn't work. It is supposed to charge and clean itself, but that only happens if you can keep the thing together, and I bet you can't. It doesn't take long for the power paw to stop working. Mine rotates so slowly if it touches anything it stops. The cleaner itself loses suction over time. The dust catcher is easy to empty, but don't forget to buy all the filters it needs. This is a poor choice
0	sharpens but doesn't do a great job . This sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access.  However it is not a good sharpener.  It sharpens knives but not well. Also, it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash.  Probably half a year and it will be useless. Spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year.
0	Not dry. I purchased this item because it claims to have effective means to prevent the food from getting wet and from clogging.  Sadly, both clogging and wetness occurred.  No user error here and this isn't my first feeder.  I returned to find the food wet and breeding some sort of weevily gnat insect, resulting in *serious* problems in my tank.  To be fair, this did occur in the humid month of August in New York and the strain proved beyond the model's capabilities (still, I was absent for only 3 day).   Maybe splashback from the fish was a problem.  Probably fine with day-to-day feeding in nonhumid climates, but why not just get a cheap, basic model for that
0	poor coating. I agree with a previous review,coating does not hold up. Comes off if bumped to hard.has been used gently and the metal is already showing. One thing I would like to know is, what is the highest temp this coating will tolerate
0	Worst Product in Our Wedding Registry. My wife and I put a white Toast-R-Oven from Black & Decker on our wedding registry, thinking it'd make a solid addition to our kitchen. Within the 1-yr warranty, our toaster oven stopped working. The button for making toast had ceased to depress and hold, requiring us to manually push down the button if we wanted to make toast. B&D had us snip the electrical cord and mail it back to them (I suppose to make sure we weren't just asking for another unit while keeping our current one).We received the replacement a few weeks later, but this one also broke. Unfortunately for us, the 1-yr warranty had just expired. This time, the problem was the heating element on the roof of the unit. One of the elements (a rod-like tube that goes lengthwise along the toaster) started giving off sparks and then collapsed. Instead of staying pressed against the top of the unit, one of the rods had partially fallen down, bending at an angle. You might think this was a case of user-error, perhaps by the owner accidentally ramming too big a chunk of food into the toaster and cracking the heating element... but I am positive that neither one of us touched the topside heating element. (We typically used it to toast Eggos and bread; with the pan, we used it to warm up leftover pizza, taco shells, cookies.)The oven no longer works since the topside no longer generates heat. The bottom still gets hot, but a funny smell permeates when the oven is activated, probably because of the broken heating element on top.Overall, this device is of such poor quality that I would not pay a single cent for another. This is the WORST item on our registry -- a piece of junk that causes headaches and frustration. I will NEVER buy another toaster oven from Black & Decker, and I am afraid to try any of their other kitchenware. I just can't trust their workmanship or design
0	USELESS--VERY ANGRY CUSTOMER. I usually like Oxo products, but this one is a real loser. Not only does it not give accurate readings (which in itself should deem it useless, being that it is a THERMOMETER after all) but there are other features that further enhance its horrible design. First of all, the "handy" (so they claim) spin dial that allows you to set the temperature that you want to reach, is so flimsy that the slightest movement of the thermometer throws the dial off. Useless. Secondly, after only one handwashing, water seeped under the dial face which is impossible to get out. The water then turns to steam which fogs up the display so you can't even read its inaccurate readings. 2 weeks later there is STILL steam under the dial. Useless again. And to pour salt on my already stinging wound, I had emailed Oxo to inquire about how to return this item and get a refund weeks ago, but they have yet to respond to me, even though on the package it states that satisfaction is 100 percent guaranteed. Well, I am NOT a satisfied customer and if my second attempt to reach them proves fruitless once again, then I doubt I will ever purchase another Oxo product again, no matter how good they are. It pains me to even give this product one star, as a product that's utterly useless deserves no star at all. Oxo should be ashamed of themselves. Thanks for allowing me to vent my 2 cents
0	Fling-it Squirrel. Although the body of the squirrel is still intact, our Pug tore the fur off the tail of the squirrel the first day he had it.  He still plays with the body and there is nothing for him to choke on, but I was disappointed that it fell apart so quickly
0	Not Blue, and you don't get two. These glasses are clear glass. There is no hint of blue, or any color or variation -- just plain glass. Also, another reviewer said you got two for this price, but that is no longer true. It looks as if they originally came in sets of two, but they have been removed from the sets and repackaged in bubblewrap. (On the outside of each box: "This is a set. Do not separate," but they are separated.)Each holds about 10 ounces
0	300 - thread-count Egyptian Cotton King Sheet set. The tags on the sheets said to wash before using. I did this and when I put them on the bed the bottom is more like a full or queen size. The top sheet is also rather small. I cannot use this product
0	tricky switch/short blade. Price was a factor in buying, but I wanted mostly for slicing bread machine bread. The bit at the end of the blades get hung up in my Presto slicing guide as the blades are too short; further, the switch is extremely temperamental and only works if you move your thumb around a lot. I'd return it, if the postage, packaging and trip to post office were worth it + trying to dig up original cash receipt! These people do NOT want return business! (They've been bought by Salton, so they use this brand for junk
0	Didn't last. The pump broke within 2 weeks and I haven't been able to find a replacement.  It would be under warranty but I threw away the paperwork (my bad) because usually I keep everything and then it just clutters up and I never have a problem.  However, I still think the product should last a little longer than that!  I purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although I had tossed the box, etc
0	returned it due to "electrical issues". I am still waiting for my refund or replacement, as I returned this item immediately as the problem with the electrical (on/off button) were a serious safety issue.  I returned this and have heard nothing from Amazon or the manufacturer.The power switch would give you a slight shock when touching to turn the item on or off, at first I thought it was just me, but after checking it several times my husband and I decided "two-to-go" although very convenient in thought was not worth risking electrical shock, or possible fire due to shortage.It has been nearly a year since the item was returned and I have had no luck from anyone in regards to a refund or replacement.
0	A Horrible Piece of Crap. Trust me, don't waste your money with this thing! I researched and shopped around for such an item and made the mistake of thinking this was good. Well, here's why it isn't:* The pump gets clogged repeatedly, every few days or so, and it's a pain to clean.* The filters don't last very long and the material of which they're made begins to "shed," so to speak, thereby falling apart enough to have their fibers in the water.* The pump doesn't last long, period. I'm on my second pump--the first one lasted only a couple months--which itself now crapped out after a month.* Mold will build up inside the unit very quickly.* If the water level gets too low, it becomes noisy.Believe me, you'll love this at first but get very frustrated with it soon enough.
0	Don't waste your money. I purchased these sheets in Feb. I washed them per the manufacturer's instructions before putting them on the bed, they never got that far! One of the pockets on the fitted sheet was torn so badly that it can't be resewn, the stitching on the sheet is very badly done, it looks like it's ready to come apart on the other pockets too. I am sending them back. The reason I rate it 1 star is because it's a beautiful color (blue) and feels very soft & thick
0	Easy Release.... in Pieces. I'm returning my pans because even though I sprayed them, the cake still stuck in parts and didn't all come out smoothly.  Plus the two layers were all warped and not the same shape.  My cakes still look bad and I'm totally disappointed.  They don't clean any easier than the metal pans.  There were also big airholes in the batter that I normally don't have - and this was a simple box cake
0	KitchenAid 16 Piece knife set. It looks attractive, but I was markedly disappointed with the lack of sharpness in all the knives.  I find myself reaching for an old set of knives to cut up vegetables.  If the fruit or veggies are nearing ripeness, the kitchenaid knives will not cut through them at all
0	Piece of crap. What a piece of crap. Just putting this together broke it. And was missing one of the snap parts. Truely a waste of money
1	Beautiful dining set!. My husband and I bought this dining set while being a little worried about some of the previous reviews about delivery problems, cracks, etc. However, we were pleasantly surprised when the table arrived in perfect condition. It took us abt. two hours to put it together, but it was not difficult at all. We have had it for about two weeks now, and so far so good! It's a very nice looking, classy table, and the color is so rich and elegant.
1	Hooray!. I bought this to help organize my children's play room and this is perfect for their board games.  Some of the games are a little long and stick out the front, but that isn't a problem.  I'm considering purchasing another for hats, gloves and the like.The item is very sturdy and built well.
1	Waterford Bedding. Waterford makes top quality, well styled bedding that lasts & lasts. We have several groups & love them all. Great product
1	I USE IT DAILY TO MAKE BACON. I like this bacon plate because of it's circular size which is great for my microwave. I use it daily to make one to three slices of bacon for family breakfast. I've had it for over six years and was looking for another one (via the internet) because it's starting to look tired and browning. I thought it was perfect until I read the negative reviews. But then again, I never tried to "grill" a burger in the microwave??? One side is smooth, I assume for defrosting and the other has elevated "grill" lines. The fat drains off nicely which I store in a baby food jar in the fridge to flavor veggies, etc. When I bought this product it did not come with a grill cover. Anytime you use a plastic cover in a microwave, the end product will be a steamed result. (Great for veggies)
1	Much better than my last fryer. Mine has been great. Keeps temperature pretty well, the heating element is MUCH better than my previous. It still drops temp when you put cold food in, but that's to be expected.As far as the house reeking of fish, open some windows. That's a circulation problem in your house, not the fryer. If you just fried fish, it's going to smell like, ... uhm... fried fish.Cleanup is incredibly easy, stainless steel looks sexy in my kitchen, and I'm very pleased with this fryer so far. I had the same "did not work" problem, but I just reseated everything (correctly) and it powered up again. That was user error on my part.Would buy again in a heartbeat
1	Love Fiestaware. My husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me. I thought okay until I opened the package. This shamrock green is so pretty. This dinnerware is great. A nice heavyweight. The glazing is brillant. And the cereal bowls are a good size. Not too small as other types tend to be. I am very happy I own this and have bought more since
1	Elegant. I was so impressed with these sheets, I immediately ordered a second set. I recently purchased a pillowtop mattress and had to replace all my bed linens to accomodate the deep pockets needed.  Out of the 5 sets I purchased, these are the BEST...outranking the Sealy sheets I bought @ $110.00 per set.  Obviously, I wish I'd found these first.  Outstanding fit, comfort and quality
1	I enjoy using this crock-pot. The pot is very easy to use and food cooks perfect
1	A book Light can be a calculator light. I got this to use with my calculator, the display of which is not back-lit, and it works like a charm
1	Honeywell HAC504 Replacement Humidifier Filter. Great price - even honored later date sale price but lacked outer evaporative "cloth" covering of original
1	my husband's valentine. This pillow was purchased for my husband who says that this is the best pillow he has ever slept on.  His neck does not hurt in the morning with this pillow
1	Gorgeous. I absolutely love this pitcher. It's both functional & gorgeous. Used as a vase filled with red roses, you'll find you can't keep your eyes off it & roses will never have looked prettier
1	microwave cook set. I have been happily surprised with the ease of cleaning and performance of these products.  I cook lots of eggs in the microwave and dread soaking and cleaning the dishes.  NordicWare is the easiest clean -- no soaking or scrubbing necessary.  Great dishes
1	Yep, it's that good. Preliminary review: I just used the aeropress for the second time and am very happy with it. I've read the reviews here and at [...] and as effusive as they were, I had one over-riding concern: would the coffee be too bland and not strong enough (with a slight bitter kick) for my taste? I like coffee black and strong; always have and always will. , Good espresso is heavenly. Therefore all the reviews about how "smooth" the aeropress coffee is made me wary. I like a touch of bitterness and distrusted the c.170 degree recommended water temperature.Anyways, the espresso came out nice and thick, very full-bodied and rich. There also was a very nice combination of enough acid with a heavy, rich taste experience. The complexity of some good beans came through, and perhaps were even enhanced over my good french press. I'm delighted.I'll come back and expand when I've used this a bit more, but as for now I highly recommend the aeropress and can assure those who may have similar concern that a hand-press won't deliver "real espresso": It does. One more word: There is real crema if one firmly pumps down an inch or two of air on top of the grounds. The quality of the crema is just so-so, (light, with no distinction) but it's there. A professional espresso machine works at about 130psi (9-10 bars/atmospheres) to get the crema everyone loves; and that is one thing, and as far as I can tell, the only thing, out of reach for the aeropress.
1	A Must-Have for Tea Drinkers. I switched from coffee to tea a few months ago, purchased this unit and am completely happy with it ... I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's well made, ergonomic, well thought out, and a joy to use.  The Japanese think of everything.  A Japanese friend of mine told me that homes in Japan almost always have one of these units, or one like it.  Now that I drink only tea, I can understand why.The three temperature settings (well, four if you count boiling) are perfect.  208 is good for herbal teas, tissanes, and also the increasingly popular (and wonderful) Rooibos.  That's also a good temperature for ramen, oatmeal, etc.  195 is good for black tea and also oolong, and 175 is good for green tea or white tea.  Now, you can make gourmet tea properly with no muss and no fuss.  Just get yourself some gourmet loose tea, herbal tea, or Rooibos, (all available from Garrett, Adagio, or Teavana), and a convenient brewer, like "IngenuiTea" from Adagio (Teavana also makes a good one that might be slightly better in quality), and you will be good-to-go!  Your taste buds will thank you and so will your body.  (The health benefits of green tea and oolong are well-known, and also Rooibos has 30-50 times the antioxidants of green tea, and no caffeine).  My blood pressure has dropped 20 points with less caffeine (compared to caffeine in coffee, black tea = 20-25%, oolong = 10-15%, green = 5-10%, white = 1%, rooibos and herbal = 0%).Buy a Zojirushi!  You won't be disappointed.
1	Great. Made my knives sharper than new.  Worked very well on serrated knives.  Extremely quick and easy to use.  Highly recommende
1	Upper back pains solved. I spent a lot of time and money on physical therapy for my weak upper back muscles.  I've tried all sorts of specialized pillows for years -- buckwheat pillows, down/feather pillows, contour pillows, memory foam pillows etc.  This was the only one that made me wake up in the mornings with no upper back pain.  It also works for my husband who likes to sleep on his side because the individual coils adjust to support the head and neck separately
1	Le Creuset Mini Cocotte. This miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces
1	Great, well-made product. Love the tilt function. I bought this slicer after very extensive comparison.  I wanted a slicer with a stronger motor, but was undecided if I really needed the tilt feature.  This slicer is very well made.  It cuts meats very thin.  I thought I would need to buy the optional blade for thin cuts, but the blade it comes with has worked perfectly for me.  I have cut up ham  and meat roasts.  The taste is wonderful, not to mention the cost savings.  I also have cut thick steaks (the ones at Costco) thinner to make steak sandwiches.  The tilt feature is advertised to gravity feed vegetables.  I use if for meat as well because the food falls away from the blade.  It is much safer and I can cut a large amout before I need to remove the accumulating pile of cut food.  I highly recommend this product.  I was also very concerned that cleaning could be so time-consuming that it might cause me to not use the product as often.  This is not the case, clean-up is a breeze and can be completed in less than 10 minutes.
1	Eclipse 12 used for Dwarf Seahorses. I purchased an Eclipse 12 so I could set it up as a habitat for dwarf seahorses.  I put a filter sponge over the intake pipe so the adults and babies would not get pulled into the filter.  I set the tank up 3 weeks before I got the seahorses so it could fully cycle.  After it was cycled I purchased 14 adult dwarf seahorses from a local dealer (I life in FL).  Within 48 hours, 2 males had given birth and another gave birth yesterday and I have seen pairs doing the courting dance so I know more babies will be on the way.  I have lost only one adult so far and the rest appear to be thriving.  I keep the tank full of newly hatched baby brine shrimp for them to feed on and I do a one gallon water change per day.  This tank is the perfect size for a population of dwarf seahorses and the filter does not make too much turbulence for them.  The lighting is enough to keep caulerpa (macro agae) and I also have a gorgonian coral in there as well.  I have always wanted to keep seahorses and now I am keeping them and raising them thank to my Eclipse 12
1	Very satisfied. This is a sturdy well made appliance.   A little soak, soap & wash gets any food   that might be  leftover in the textured surface.   I don't know that the textured surface serves a major purpose because it is so slight of a texture.  I am getting ready to buy this same appliance for my mother in law
1	permanent filter. I have a combination Krups unit in white for both the coffee and expresso that is so old that I don't think they make that color any more. Bought this filter the day I got the machine use it almost every day. I use Folgers gourmet dark in this unit and with that size of grinds have no problem with residue in the pot. It is as good as gold. The brightness of the gold faded long ago but performance remains the same. My white pot lid however is bowning with age. The filter is older than my grand children and still works well. Hand wash don't scrub
1	suprised/ a neat bowl. I debated on buying these for 3 weeks was not sure what they would look like,...I very please when they arrived,neat bowls,they look like cerel bowls,handels on the side.I done puddings and oin soup so far,graet clean up and I like the look.A step up from a cerel bowl
1	These towels are wonderful!. I ordered the Shadow Green and I love the soft green color it is beautiful!  The towels are thick, abosorbent and luxurious feeling
1	HEPA Filter - Hamilton Beach. Excellent product which does exactly what it is advertised to do
1	Saved my wardrobe. I live in a tiny Manhattan apartment with basically one closet. This device literally saved me from having to weed through my closet and give my clothes away to goodwill.It manages to double up the space in your closet and allow you so much more room to "breath" -- allowing you to get all the clothes into a limited space.I put my blazers and dresses on the top rail, and then on the hanging part, I put all my skirts.It's efficient and nicely designed and worked wonders with my cramped closet space.It's great
1	Mrs. Anderson's Pie Crust Shield saves the day!. I LOVE this product!  I have been waiting all week for it to arrive, and it finally did today!  I baked my pie (I've been anticipating this moment for days), and when it came out of the oven, there were no spills to clean  up!  And my crust, lets just say it was a perfect golden brown, light and  flaky, mmmmmmm......
1	AWESOME PRODUCT!!. I bought this for my older cat who has no body fat on her. It serves a dual purpose in that it protects her favorite chair from the majority of the hair she sheds; but the best thing about it is the warmth it provides to her. Yes, it does "crinkle" as the previous reviewer said. That didn't bother my cat though. She took to it right away. The faux fur provides comfort and warmth and the "crinkly" stuff on the inside reflects back her body heat. I rested my feet and calves on it one day while I was napping on the couch; I can verify that it actually works in reflecting back your body heat; my legs were kept toasty by this pad. No wonder my cat loves it. Highly recommended
1	Great surface. I have an extra wide ironing board and the cover that came with it was so thin. This cover makes a great surface to iron on, almost make me want to iron!
1	Great Product. This is my 3rd pressure cooker. The last 2 higher end products. Broke within the 1st year with just average use. This pressure cooker is simple, basic and so far withstanding the abuse. Super Fast shipping.
1	The best thing I ever bought for my kitchen. I have a small, one person kitchen with very little storage.  The hanging pot rack saved more space than I thought it would.  Assembly was simple - we only had to go out and buy the hanging hooks (as they do not come with the pot rack) and we had it up and functional in about 20 minutes.  I love the lid feature on top of the rack - it's so much more convenient than having to search for lids in a cupboard.  I bought two of the hanging pot racks and would recommend them to anyone
1	EXCELLENT transaction!!!. Fastest shipping ever!  Thank you so much, we will buy from you again
1	Strong little hand blender. This hand blender is much stronger than the previous blender I owned. The blade is very sharp and a workhorse for its size
1	Great Waffle Iron - Great Price. I really like this waffle iron. It's EASY to use and makes waffles FAST. I bought two - one for a gift and one to keep (got free shipping, too). I recommend it.
1	Great Pie Dish. This is a large deep pie dish.  The shape of the dish yields a beautiful pie, especially apple
1	Heavy Weight Guest Towels. Columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time I didn't use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom. The color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender, they call it Plumberry. The weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well, that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it. When the washcloths are completely drenched, they do seem a little more heavy than most, although they have that "spa feel" to them and they retain heat very well, which makes them sort of comforting. I've tried many towels and these are the most absorbent I've found. They are made with 100% combed cotton and have a heavier feel. The edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they don't fall apart the first time you wash them.~The Rebecca Review
1	Does just what it says it does. I've owned my Duet for well over 2 years and I'm a bit baffled by the negative reviews I'm reading here at Amazon.  Perhaps Cuisinart has produced a few lemons?  I've had absolutely no problems with it and it hasn't even hinted at breakage, cracking, or anything else.  I use it several times per week, both blending and food processing and overall, I'm very satisfied.Combining a powerful motor with the dual functions of processing and blending is a natural idea and works well.  Switching between blending and processing is quick and easy and the pieces fit well together with no leakage and seamless operation.  The base houses the power and the Duet really does blend as well as any blender I've ever used including the Waring Pro.  The buttons are flush and seamless with the display background, so cleanup is easy and the base is heavy, solid, and will not tip over easily.  The blender blades are sharp, so handle and wash them with care.The processor bowl is a bit small and is good for small and medium-sized tasks such as making salsa, pesto, sauces, tapenade, etc.  The shredder/slider insert works like a charm and I've used it mainly for vegetables and cheeses.  The placement is just about perfect and although others have complained that the feeding tube is too small, I've never had a problem inserting everything/anything into it and obtaining the desired results.  It's really pretty logical.Any gripes?  Besides the processor bowl being small, my main complaint concerns the number of speed selections.  The selections go from stir to chop to ice crush to food processor and the difference between chop and ice crush is a huge one.  I would prefer that there be an intermediate speed that allows for a quick blend with less of a danger of pureeing the blender's contents than if ice crush or food processor is selected.  Since all the speeds apply to both blending and processing, this would be a logical improvement.  Another improvement would be a better-fitting clear plastic insert to the blender lid.  Mine is too loose and considering this is placed over rapidly gyrating liquids, a tighter fit would give me more confidence that I'm avoiding flying food.Again, I've had no reliability/durability issues with the Duet.  Other than a couple of minor design flaws, I enjoy using it regularly.  Here are a few tips that might help you enjoy your appliances for a longer period:Although many companies claim their products are dishwasher safe, it's better to hand wash as many pieces as is logical.  In this case, hand wash the blender blade mechanism -- doing so will maintain the sharpness of the blades and the plastic attachment pieces will fit better longer and won't crack or break.  Use hot, soapy water and a mild detergent.  Pieces like the processor and blender bowls should be sanitized in the dishwasher.Handle your appliances with care.  Don't toss them around or bang them against other objects.  Store them carefully by avoiding piling things on top of them or shoving them into too-small spaces.  Put pieces and attachments together carefully.If possible, roughly cut up your food prior to processing and blending.  This will assist in achieving the desired results and will avoid problems like unprocessed lumps, inconsistent blending, or sudden bursts within the food bowl.  It also reduces the need to stop the machine and scrape the sides.  Don't just shove the food in, turn it on and expect great results.Remember, these are not commercial-grade appliances and as another reviewer has mentioned, even if they were, a professional would not abuse his/her equipment.  Treat your appliances well and they'll do the same for you.  The Cuisinart SmartPower Duet is no exception.Recommended.
1	OVE Glove. I love.No more burnt fingers and the price special was just right as well.  Get one- or two
1	happy so far. we bought this heater almost a year ago to use in the home office area.  we have no heating system in that room and it gets pretty cold. we keep honeywell running at 70F for approximately 6 hours a day and it works fine and heats up the room efficiently.  yesterday we purchased the delonghi TRN0812T to put in the baby's room to save some space. we hope delonghi will do the job as good as honeywell
1	GREAT COUNTERTOP WATER SYSTEM. We used the Britta system for almost 9 years to filter our nasty tasting local water.  We were becoming dissatisfied with the "floating" carbon particles with each filter change and found that the filters were not taking out all of the bad taste.  We decided to give the PUR countertop system a try - about the same price as Britta to set up - and were amazed at the better quality of filtered water! The taste is great and no more carbon floaters from the filters.  The only "complaint" would be that these filters are harder to find and more expensive than Britta.  The extra cost is worth it
1	powerful!. This blender is very powerful. The lid is a little difficult to take off, only a minor issue with me
1	This one's a winner!. Tired of a hot lap(top)? The Lapinator is the answer.  I highly recommend this item and I have thoroughly tested it.
1	Cute and reliable, missing a couple features. Have had this for 6 months and it works great. People always compliment me on how stylish it looks!As noted in another review, it's hard to get the toast out early. The only other nitpick I have is that there isn't a timer associated with the toaster over -- others I have can turn off automatically when they hit a time limit, but this one you have to watch. Has not led to disaster yet, though..
1	Great for those with limited space, excellent invention! Some minor pitfalls:. First of all, I love these. They fold neatly, take up little cabinet space, etc.However, it does NOT say on the package that they are microwave or freezer safe. I find that info only here on AMazon which leaves me wondering...are they or aren't they?Secondly, because the flattened containers have to be pushed open, these might be difficult for an elderly person to handle. It isn't exactly hard to do but does take at least normal strength, average strength, not something a weak, ill or otherwise impaired person might manage. Other than that, I think they are great. They clean up nicely, store food, the lids stay in place, etc.Now if I only know about their microwave capabilities!
1	Easiest furniture to put together. My husband and I just bought 4 of the Santa Fe pieces.  I have been putting similar furniture together for years, this is by far the easiet ever to put together, the directions were easy to follow everything lined up perfectly and the quality is wonderful.
1	good buy. bought this for my automatic cat box seems to work well with it.I do think the odor control could be better I recommend using a sprinkle on odor control.overall it cleans up way better than traditional litter and without the dust
1	Great little instant read thermometer. I have this thermometer in black and it's been great.Important tip to note:  Stick the metal tip into item, let it sit for a couple of seconds and then turn on the thermometer.  Do this and you'll get the instant read feature.  If you turn it on first, the thermometer will show the temperature of the air, then you stick it into the item and the display will slowly move to the temperature of the item.  This takes a bit of time.  So be sure you stick it into your item FIRST, let the metal acclimate to the temperature of the item, and then turn it on.  Then you'll get the instant read each time.I've washed this, I've dropped it, and it's still going strong.  It's not a replacement for an oven thermometer or a probe thermometer, but it's great at what it's designed for - a quick and easy instant read thermometer
1	Amazon was the answer to my Christmas gift-giving problems. I was looking for a tea kettle for my sister for Christmas and couldn't find one anywhere.  Finally I tried Amazon and came up with a new problem, which one to choose.  Amazon had a wide variety of items to choose from.  Their prices were excellent and with their Super Saver shipping, I saved a lot of money shopping online versus a store.  The kettle came very fast and was everything I wanted it to be.  It's not some cheap, flimsy tea kettle but the real deal.  My sister loved it.  I would definitely recomment using Amazon for anything you're looking for.  The prices are great and you can't beat the convenience
1	Great knife. I purchased this for my wife.  A hundred bucks for a knife insane!  Until you use it.  I think this is worth the money.  My wife says is the best thing since sliced bread.  And... you can slice bread with it.   Seriously, great knife.  It will last a long time.  Don't keep buy cheapo knives year after year.  Just get one of these.  Very sharp edge, nice weight, and comfortable.
1	pleasure. Keeps my butter (the real stuff, not margarine) soft and able to spread on soft bread.  Love it
1	Mugs to match nice dishes!. Who really uses cups and saucers any more? Maybe for a formal company dinner or fancy tea party.The cups that come with the sets of Mikasa Antique White dishes hold 8 ounces (with sipping room). These mugs hold 12 ounces. They have a great slim style and are made of a more refined china than most casual mugs. One consideration: they do not hold the heat like a big, clunky mug. So if you drink your coffee slowly, you may be zapping it more often
1	Media Storage Review. This is the best all-around media storage cabinet i have owned in over 25 years of storing media.  It's outside design is great.  The shelving design inside is flexible so you may use it to hold CDs, DVDs, Videos, including those "non-standard sized special edition sets" if you like.  It's durable.  I've bought six of these and placed two in 3 of the rooms in my house, each of which have different furniture/spacing availability and I've found that these are the right overall size for all of my conditions.
1	Smelling like a rose. For  years our garbage has gone into a 1 gallon plastic pitcher.  No amount of washing could keep it socially acceptable. A new era began with the purchase of this wonderful little can.  It's very sturdy, the top fits securely but not tightly (can be opened with one hand every time) and you can't smell a thing!  Capacity is generous.  I'm in love
1	Great whisk. I've owned this whisk for about a year now, and I'm quite happy. It is pretty small, but that's great for me since I don't make any large batches of anything.  It's easy to store, goes in the dishwasher easily, and it's as good as the day I bought it.
1	I HATE spiders. The vacuum works great. It would be perfect if the bugs didn't need to get removed from the part where they are zapped. I would also make the top part a little softer to get a tighter fit in corners.I have tried everything and this is the best product I have found
1	excellent product and service. These wicks are excellent - original product, not a knock off.  Great value, quick delivery
1	Tumblers. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my order arrived. They were exactly what I was searching for!  Because they are insulated the tumblers don't "sweat" so no need for coasters to protect the surfaces they are placed on. Also, no need for constantly adding ice to beverages...it seems to last forever
1	the smell of morning coffee. This is close to the same coffee maker my dad's girlfriend uses.  Sometimes I get confused when I'm in the back room on the computer and I hear the coffee maker turn on by itself (thanks to a timer).  I think it's strange how your coffee will make itself while you're still asleep.   When I hear it start up and see no one in the kitchen I think "ok, a ghost must be around me right now".  It's like we're living like the Jetsons or the Exorcist.According to everyone who uses Black & Decker, this is a good coffee maker (and the white color matches everything else in the kitchen).  The only thing I don't know is if it's safe to get water under the coffee maker (since it's located next to the sink and no matter how hard you try, water will squirt over there).  Of course I don't deliberately splash water under it to see if a fire starts, but I always make sure it's dry under there.  I can only imagine it's developed for the best safety.
1	A Wonderful Oven Mitt. An excellent product!  They work exactly as advertised.  They're good looking and comfortable as well as functional
1	Took 2 tries. The first set came very very broken.  I sent them back and got another set just fine
1	Clean Air. My wife and I noticed the difference within a day of using it.  We felt better in the morning.  Neither of us has been sick this Winter after using it for several months.  And I was amazed at how much dust was on the pre-filter when I replaced it for the first time.  I'm so glad we bought it.  Note: As with all HEPA filters it does make noise.  I recommend buying a large one and running it on low when you're sleeping in the room.
1	Super Great!. This bowl is very durable and I love the different colors that it comes in.  The bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times.  We basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream, popcorn, nachos, etc.  I love these bowls and am going to buy a set of Fiestaware for my mom
1	I Want To Buy More Of This Item (in varying sizes). Recently purchased this in mid-2006 and it is the best cookware item I have ever owned and used.  As one of those millions who rely on mid-line priced discount department store brands, I can state with 100% certainty I was amazed (and still am) with the high-performance this item offers!  The clean-up is still a dream-come-true, all I have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse, it practically cleans itself.  My burners are all equal size (gas stove) and highest setting is "6" I have learned all I have to do for pancakes is level 3!!  Cooking bacon, an entire pound, is no problem for this cookware.  I do want to purchase more of this item, there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available.  I'm even thinking of slowly switching to this brand "All-Clad" nonstick
1	Humidifier. We like the product. There is not a lot of noise and refilling is easy.
1	Great Product. Using this product for about 4 months now and it's simply great.  This unit received a lot of use during the Holidays and it never missed a beat.  I've read a few reviews here and they seem either fake or the folks didn't understand how to operate it and should probably go back to a Fry Daddy for simplicity.  The Euro does require that you get the unit set in the rails to trip the safety switch and you do need to keep this thing clean.  I change the oil about every 2 months - depending on how much protein I fry.  Nice to be able to put the tub in the dishwasher and looks like new upon reassembling.  The MAJOR difference between this unit and several others I've owned is the larger capacity (4 liters!).  Capacity is very important in keeping the oil to temperature and keeping the food less greasy.  In addition to the capacity, the wattage is upped to 1800 watts which is above par for consumer level fryers. This is one of the largest capacity home fryers around at this price.  Fried zucchini and mushrooms are simply restaraunt quality!  I also recommend experimenting with batters - search the net for this (i.e. use Italian dry mix in flour for a KFC type fried chicken - good stuff!)
1	Good low end but check out new Vivants. I got a bunch of Overtures when Amazon was discounting them heavily but never did like the stumpy proportions. Now Riedel has apparently come out with a new low end line, Vivant, that it is selling through Target which is available through Amazon web site. For about the same price, it appears that you get a somewhat better glass
1	Really Surprised How Strong This Vacuum Is. in picking up hair and animal hair. Crevice quick flip makes it easy to use for hard to reach places, picking up the dirt! Downside is the small dirt container but that is minor vs. the power this small machine has
1	Beautiful pattern and delicate cup. Teacup and saucer are even more intricate than pictured.  Also, Amazon did a fabulous job with careful packaging and shipped very promptly
1	Great product. Works as advertized. Heavy Duty. Easy to clean. Kids use it almost every night to mix milkshakes. They prefer it to our blender.
1	Pretty serving tray... Pretty serving tray, my only complaint is that I thought it might be a bit taller, but it will still do it's job at a buffet table.  Very pretty and great for the price.  The glass is nice and thick and the line of products is beautiful.  I do see the handle becoming a problem after constant use, but who uses these things constantly.  My problem I mean the silver coming off.  Still recommend it.  You won't regret it
1	Good price, good item!. My bofriend and I were moving into a small house with no counter space and knew that we needed something to put our microwave on.  I had gone on Target.com to see what they had and was dissapointed to see the bad reviews for this particular product.  The other day though, I couldn't beat the price so I bought it hoping the people who wrote the bad reviews had put it together wrong.  This product is great! It holds our medium sized microwave, our toaster on the slide-out rack and our quesidilla maker on the bottom rack.  The four hooks on the side are great for our hot mits and hot pads.  This product was very easy to assemble and it didn't take that long either.  I would highly recommend buying it and making sure that you read the directions carefully
1	White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer. We were very pleased with the White Mountain ice cream maker. It brings back fun memories of when we were kids while making new ones with our kids
1	Love our V1725T Shark!. I absolutely Hate to vacuum and anything that postpones it is great in my book.  Most vacuums are so loud and heavy that I hate to drag them out every time crumbs are dropped on the floor.  We also have a cat that likes to make a mess.  This product is an extra help around the litter box.  This product is very light and easy to use.  The handle swivels with ease so you can get things at an angle and the base isn't too tall to fit under the couch.  I have been using mine for about 7 months and have yet to have a problem with it
1	Best stand fan. It is powerful, attractive, and extremely reliable. Easy to assemble and the remote is great
1	Great silverware. Very good quality silverware.  We bought it to match with an existing set of Henckles silverware.  This Oneida is holding up to washings and little kids much better than the Henckles has.Excellent product!
1	Dyson. Impressive machine overall.  I've had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch.  Looking around on the internet, this seems to be fairly common.  I understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things, but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine.The attachments are great for hard floors, and furniture.I am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time I use the machine, but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point, even the refurbished one
1	Fiesta Ware. I have used the same Fiesta Ware for the last 12 years and I have not broken a piece yet!  Even when my 2 teenage boys were babies, and doing dishes, a piece may have slipped out of their hands, but nothing was ever broken.  This shows how durable the Fiesta Ware really is.  I would highly recommend Fiesta Ware to everyone of all ages.  I own 3-20 piece settings at the present time and plan on expanding.  I like the fact that you can collect all different colors and it looks great!  I will be ordering more for when my 2 boys go to college.  I plan on ordering my mother a 20 piece set for her birthday.  I love it and I know you would toooo
1	Good Report on  Dualit Toaster. For more years then I want to count I have been fussing with one or more Big Box Store toasters and found they all came up realy short on many fronts. I decided to purchase the Dualit as an alternative to the morning frustrations. I am thrilled with it's operation and do agree that any number on the dial above 3 is only there to make a person feel powerful as they are not needed. Thanks again for building a fine product
1	great skillets. These are just great and the price sure is right....the large skillet is deep and great for frying....about $20.00 cheaper then the cheapest place I found.....I love them and you will to..
1	LTD is the absolute BEST!. This cookware is without peer. I know, I have been using my first LTD pan since 1989 and have purchased many others since. That 1989 pan still looks nearly new. LTD cooks better than anything else and cleans like a dream. The unfortunate, dissatisfied person that put this cookware into a dishwasher, simply did not read or heed the care instructions provided by All-Clad. There is absolutely no reason to ever even think of putting an LTD or ANY fine pan into a dishwasher. And even though this person has damaged the appearance of this pan, its use and cooking performance have been unaffected. Any cooked on food can be removed without effort by simply soaking it with soap and warm water. The exterior is best cleaned with a paste made of "Barkeepers Friend" and water applied with minimal elbow grease and a cloth. This will remove ALL traces of oil or grease residue, just like All-Clad recommends. Finally, I believe that, with a minimum of reasonable care, LTD cookware will provide a lifetime of daily pleasurable cooking experience and is worth every single penny of its cost. All-Clad guarantees it in writing
1	great product. This product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments I had received there.  Zymox takes about a week to work, with one or two treatments a day.  It has had the same effect for my sister's dog who had had recurrent ear infections. I have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success
1	Rooster Pasta Set. I'm very happy with this pasta set.  It exactly matches the dinnerware set and the quality is great.  The pasta bowl is HUGE!  I am considering a second set to complete 8 place settings.  The second pasta bowl would make an excellent salad bowl..
1	great so far. i've had mine 7 months, and used another one for much longer at a previous residence. never had the mold problem others have reported. i love it. the capacity is great and the nozzle is perfect for refilling bottles, and never drips. my only complaint used to be hauling it into the sink to fill, but my boyfriend had the brilliant idea to leave it on the counter and use the faucet hose. =
1	R2D2. Cute little pudge looks just like the charactor from Star Wars.  I bought a new stove and it gives one little buzz and then stops.  I was burning too many cookies, so I bought the Kitchenaid Timer. After years of plastic junk, I am very happy to have a quality timer.  It is completely enclosed, with no crevices, so you can pick it up with your gunky hands and just wipe it off when you're done.  It has an ingenius way of activating, but as soon as you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  It rings long and loud, which makes me happy
1	Great for ice cream and a hit with preschoolers. We use these for everything: berries, nuts, raisins, yogurt, ice cream.  My nephew loves them for his chocolate chips, Annie's bunny crackers, raisin and blueberry mixes, and frozen berries...and, of course, ice cream.  They're ideal for smaller portions.  They're easy to clean and dishwasher safe
1	Visual Wine Decanter. Very pretty, space efficient and the design allows for good aeration of the wine. This was a hit. The recommended knob I ordered was the only miss.
1	Great product. Just got this in the mail today - excellent addition to our 29 gallon tank!  We have two red-eared sliders, and they are still pretty small.  This ramp will accommodate them until their shell is about 3-4 inches in width.Super-easy to install.  Fast delivery as well, and item was packaged well
1	Great little machine. After reading many reveiews on this product I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I hate the public laundry so I thought this would be a little bit better even if I had some of the problems other people had mentioned. I had the same problems with the screws that every one else did. The screws dont match up to the holes to screw on the bottom panel. You have to kind of force them in where they dont belong and then screw them on. I also have to weigh down the water out house into the sink or it will flip out of the sink from the water pressure and end up all over the floor. I thought it would be sufficent enough to just place it in the sink, however I learned my lesson after the first load! You can fit quite a bit in it despite the small size, however I would not try to overload the washer as the water level will get too high and overflow. I am able to wash with the water level on high as long as the washer is not too stuffed up. Overall if you can iron out the little kinks with the washer, it is much better than public laundry and will save you a lot of money over the long run. As opposed to the rolling thing for the bottom I got those furniture sliders and they work GREAT to move it from one side of the kitchen to the next.
1	Beautiful dishes. Dishes are just as pretty as they look but are not quite as bright colored as they show.  Are a nice color, would not want them any brighter. Plates and bowls are a nice size. Cup could be a little bigger but the size most sets carry. Waiting for add on pieces. I have a light tan colored rice bowl and vegetable size bowls from my other set that I bought seperately that matches these pretty well that I kept.  Like the rice bowl size really well for soups. They are Corelle extras. Rgis is my 3rd set of Corelle.
1	Great little oven. This is a great little oven.  It reaches temperature fast and it stays at temperature.  The convection oven fan is a little noisy, but not annoying.  The rotisserie feature works great, but don't expect to do any large items.  Cornish hens is the limit or a very small chicken. This oven works great for drying peppers.  I use my drying racks from my old Toastmaster convection oven
1	Must have for wood and tile floors!. When we purchased our Dyson, I read about this tool in some of the reviews and decided to purchase the Factory-Reconditioned unit and use the money we saved to get this accesory.This was a great choice, we love the vacuum and this tool does an outstanding job on our wood and tile floors.  I think it does a great job on steps also.  It has greatly expanded the functionality of the basic Dyson, and is well worth the extra cost
1	cats are never thirsty. the capacity is great. We have several cats and one small dog and the dish is never dry.  We only need to fill it every other day.The biggest part is keeping an eye on the tank.  I wish the flow was a little stronger but that is on another model.  Very happy with the delivery time and all of the packing to make sure it got to me in one piece
1	Top rate multi-purpose sheet!. As a serious cook, I look for tough uncoated surfaces that won't rust or require such ginger care. The pan is sturdy, priced right, fits perfectly in the oven without a rack and cleans up like a dream. NordicWare is great!Whether roasting vegetables, roasting a turkey or baking sheets of brownies or cookies, it distributes heat evenly without burning and does a consistent job every time. No need for wooden or teflon utensils, you can use whatever you want, whenever you want. If you're looking for a non-stick surface, add parchment or a silpat that browns cookies evenly and lets you slide them right off.I like this pan so much, I own 4 so I can rotate them and do a great amount of baking without waiting for the sheets to cool. It also ensures they stack nicely in the cabinet. The lid is a nice addition, making it convenient and secure to store cookies and brownies right on the sheet without removing them or worrying if the saran wrap or foil will slip off.Bravo
1	Wusthof Slicer. Was a Christmas gift for my son-in-law and he was very pleased. This is the second Wusthof knive I have given him.  Excellent
1	sturdy and convenient. With six children, myself and my husband, sometimes just collecting the laundry from all over the house leaves me worn out.  That's why I like the wheels on this hamper; they help conserve my energy, and I need all the energy I can get.  Plus this hamper can hold all the laundry from my laundry chute, and it's construction seems sturdy.  It was pretty easy to assemble
1	Nice looking and Useful. Came on time and in great condition.  I use a lot of European recepies, so I stumble on a lot of metric measurements; so I am happy to know that this scale provides weight in grams/kilos/lbs/oz.  Very useful to me as I cook a lot from scratch
1	The Best!. This is such a great pan for omlets because of the sloped sides that allow you to slide underneath.  This would be a great first peice of cast iron for someone new to using it because of the size and it is pre-seasoned.  I use it all the time &amp; it just keeps getting better
1	feels great. no complain! felt very good to touch. wormed me during very cold nights.I wish if I had more options in the choice of color
1	Relaxing!. I tend to stress out a bit so my husband bought me this for my office as a stress reliever.  I love it! It is a great way to zone out for a little while.
1	FIESTA!. This is a great idea!  Everyone should have AT LEAST ONE of these ~ personally I'd get one for every member of the household.  The well is perfect so theres no slipping or sliding and it can easily be carried without having to worry about it falling off.  We love this.  And this is a great color.  So much prettier than the picture.
1	Regarding DeLonghi. I have had a DeLonghi for several years now (different model). To be sure, I have had to replace the grommet and the stupid plastic "crema maker." I poked around in my phone book a bit, got the parts without problem. The plastic part broke again, but I find I really don't care -- it has no impact on the coffee
1	Great gate, but read my review before buying. I just bought this gate because I needed something semi-permanent in my living room to keep my new puppy from running all over the house. My first gate looked very cheap and kept falling down because it didn't have a door and I just propped it against the wall. I needed a gate with a door.I checked at least 3 different sites besides Amazon for a "rich" looking gate WITH a door. I landed on this one.PROS:1.) Looks nice and elegant2.) The door swings open both ways (very nice)3.) Brown / tan (much nicer than the plastic grey colors like Grayco)4.) Solid design (wood and steel, nice)5.) The gate locks at the top and the bottom at the same time, making it impossible for my puppy to push his way through at the bottom.6.) Lock is nicely positioned (but see #5 in the CONS below).CONS:1.) ONLY the door is wood, ALL of the gate material is metal. Would be nicer is the entire gate was the same wood and the hardware was metal.2.) The door does not swing 180 degrees open. The door only opens to about 110 degrees so because it's not flush with the gate, my dog or kids sometimes run into it.3.) The color of the gate does not match the door. It's close and it compliments it, but it's not a match.4.) The rubber feet that touch the wall (I'm not talking about the adjuster knobs, because they are brown) to hold it in place against the wall are grey. At this price, they should be brown to match the gate. I don't know how the company missed this one.5.) The handle to open the gate only works in "baby-proof" mode. I which you could deactivate the thumb button and make it so that you only have to lift up on the handle to open. Not the thumb & lift up. Just a convenience thing. It's sometimes a little tricky when both your handles are full with grocery bags.6.) The screws are shiny silver. They should have painted them brown as well. (Richell, it your reading this, you could have anodized them dark brown like some many other screws, that way they're less noticeable.)7.) THIS IS THE BIGGY **IMPORTANT** This gate only works in certain segments. Unless you're really handy with tools and a welding torch you must pay attention to this. This gate will ONLY fit on the following openings, NO EXCEPTIONS:35" to 37" with no side gates (just door)47" to 49" with one side gate attached59" to 61" with both side gates attachedWhen I bought this gate, I didn't understand this and I was lucky that my opening is 47". If it was only 45" I would have had to return this gate. There is no way around this.Overall this is a quality gate, but just know what you're getting.I would buy this gate again if I had to make this choice all over.I gave this gate 4 stars instead of 5 because only the door was wood. If the gates and door were wood, I would have given it 5 stars
1	A great way to prevent a fire!. I purchased this for my mother who has melted more than one pan on her stove and has collection pot and pans with delaminated bottoms.  She finds this timer very easy to set and very good at waking her when she wears it around her neck
1	Excellent Quality. I received my roaster within 3 days of ordering.  It was excellent quality and made of commercial-grade aluminum with a thick bottom on the pan.  The lid fit tightly and allowed the food to cook properly with no loss of moisture.  I would highly recommend this product.  Thanks Amazon
1	Great towels for price!. Purchased  5 sets of these towels.Bought 2 sets at 29.99 apiece and 3 sets at 19.99 apiece.Very soft and large towels.Very pleased with this purchase.Found some loose threads but not significant enough to complain about.Recommend buying as this was a great deal for a high quality item.Plan on ordering more
1	maryM. This is an excellent pressure cooker at an excellent price. I do feel they should have included a trivet and metal plate. All of the accessories are extra.I ordered the canning rack which holds 4 pints. I don't believe it would be wise to try to can quarts in this one, but the directions were not clear. In fact, I would have given this a much higher rating if they were, but I had trouble figuring out how to use it...and one does want to follow directions where a pressure cooker is concerned. They kept referring to to pressures, hi and low. I finally realized the 6 qt model has both but not the 10 and the directions were applicable to each model. The 10 quart pressures at 15 lbs....FAST!I once had Fagor 6 qt model and the  metal was heavier than this one. However, the upside is that it is easier to lift up to pour things from it which is a plus if you're elderly as I am.I really like they way this cooks; fast, easy to clean. It's beautifully designed pan.There are numerous uses for non-pressure cooking too. Big enough for a stock pot, cooking spagetting for a crowd, etc etc.I haven't canned with it. However, I plan on making a big pot of soup and canning what's left.One reviewer mentioned that you can't fill it over 2/3 full. That is true of ANY pressure cooker. So if you are debating between a 6 quart or a 10 quart, go for the 10 quart.There are additional accessories for this..canning rack, bucket insert (for spaghetti, etc.)  I recommend getting the lid for non-pressured food and keep the pressure lid for pressure.I don't think you will be disappointed with this product.
1	A point of clarification. So that other readers are not mislead:A tea pot is designed to hold hot water and tea leaves so as to steep the tea.A tea kettle is designed to hold water to be heated, preferably on the stove top.I do not recommend using a microwave to heat water as that method of heating invariably seems to alter the flavor of the water - at least if you are serious about your tea
1	Polycarbonate is the way to go!. These polycarbonate glasses are terrific! What the manufacturer says is true:  They really don't break and they don't show wear from the dishwasher.  I suppose if you tried jumping up and down on one or ran over it with a steam roller, it make break.  But these glasses have survived my three kids, and that's a pretty big feat.  And they look great.  Just like glass.  You might think it's made of glass until you pick it up.  A great product for people with kids, or for use in your RV, on your boat, out on the patio, by the pool, etc.
1	microsuede duvet set. Great duvet and pillow shams for the price.  Soft and comfortable.a great buy
1	Perfect for a meal serving!. This plate is perfect for serving a nice amount of food in the center of the table or for a larger single meal for one person.  Very sturdy but not overly-heavy.  The Sango Gold Dust set has been very nice!  Amazon.com is the only place I can find the accesories for this set at a reasonable price.  And most of them you cant find in the store
1	Brita your water. Very satisfied with the system.  Makes water tastes go away.  Water should not have a taste at all and brita makes it that way
1	Business Is Picking Up. I have Great Danes and can't find any of these in suitable sizes locally. These are not the toy scoops one can get in pet stores. If you have a large dog or many dogs or miniature horses, regular horses, elephants --- these are for you
1	Scooba floor washer. I bought this product because I liked the vaccumn so much. It stood up to my expectations.
1	good item. I really like the design, they are easier to take out than the square design. when you place them on the fridge you place one faceing one way and the other one the other way and well never compleatly full or else then its a bit dificult to ake them out.the only thing i don't like much is the material that is made of its not too resistant.
1	Versatile Chip and Dip. This chip and dip is on my bridal registry but I received it early, as a birthday gift. I just LOVE it!  During the holiday's I used it for shrimp and cockail sauce. I actually got several complements on the piece (who compliments bowls anyway!). It is just so beautiful, almost too nice for plain 'ole chips!
1	Milano Espresso To Go. I love the end product. Has the appearance and feel of a chair worth twice the price and was exactly what I wanted.However!!! The instructions for assembly leave certain steps to the imagination. At one point in the assembly there were 2 possible ways to go. I guessed correctly and did not have to backtrack and take anything apart. A bit of a frustrating experience to say the least.Is the frustration worth it? Without a doubt
1	So far so good. This item has broken on a few people, so I will update this  review if it breaks.  So far I really like it.  The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it seems a tad tall for no real reason.  Otherwise it is great.  The grind indicator works well once you get a feel for it, although you can do about as well by  looking at the grinds yourself as it is grinding.  It is also nice that is has a skinny middle coated with rubber so it is easy to hold without slipping.  I guess making the skinny middle part may be why it is a bit tall.  The look is realy cool and the wind up cord is great too.Ok, the update: three years later in 2006 this thing is still going strong, despite my dumping boiling water in it to clean it and doing other non-manufacturer-approved stuff to it.  Two thumbs up
1	Wilton cake pan. Wilton makes the best products for any baker! I only use Wilton when it comes to making decorative cakes for my friends and family.This cake pan makes the perfect half sheet cake
1	CORELLE DISHES. I ORDERED 3 SETS SO I WOULD HAVE A SERVICE OF 12. IT IS HARD TO FIND DISHES WITH TRUE RED ON THEM, I HAVE LOOKED EVERY WHERE I WAS HAPPY TO FIND THESE
1	Wonderful for your kiddos!!. My grandson loves his comforter.  He won't let you take it off his bed even to make it.  Very good quality and so very cute.  I would advise any Thomas fan to get this one for your little one(s).  God bless you all
1	fridge into wine!. Not bad. this bottle rack set is a little tricky to put together but can turn those empty refrigerator shelves into wine storage. Make 'em as high or as wide as you want. A good deal given the price
1	West Bend Wok. I purchased this item as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law.  She had one previously,  but it wore out and we were unable to find a replacement.   She absolutely loves the West Bend Wok and says one of the features she especially likes is the fact that it maintains a certain temperature throughout the whole cooking process, rather than low, medium or high with the control switching off as soon as it reaches that temperature. It is easy to clean and hopefully will last "forever"!
1	You can't beat Raclette!. I first tried a Raclette prepared meal in 2002 while visiting my fiancee's parents in Lyon, France. Needless to say I was hooked straight away. Although Raclette meals can be heavy (potatoes, cheese and various meats and veg), they are extremely good.The Hamilton beach 31602 raclette grill is great. Temperature control is a nice feature. I have used it a lot since I bought it and recommend it. Good value for money and even has some recipes to try in the instruction manual.
1	THE BEST  WINE OPENER!!. My husband drinks A LOT of wine, so any wine opener really gets a workout at our house.  This is the second Vacu Vin Winemaster Corkscrew we've had, and it's worth every penny of its $50 price tag.  We've had many other types of wine openers, and they had to be replaced every few months.  The Vacu Vin Winemaster has lasted for over six years so far
1	Perfect Size. I love this decanter for it is the perfect size.  Had one before and I broke it so I went online and got the same one again
1	Dog loves it, but it needs a carrying case. This product is sturdy and has plenty of room for my 9.5 lb shih tzu.  It's easy to use, and Lucy loves it.  The only thing I wish is that there was an option to purchase a well-made carrying case to put crate in when not in use and we need to tote it from one place to another.  For example, I'd like to be able to check it at the airport and feel that it's somewhat protected.  (Lucy travels on-board w/ us in an airline approved pet carrier.)
1	Cuisinart's Chef's Classic Series is a Best Value. We have owned varies types of cookware in the past 20+ years.  Some we have had to throw away, some were passed down to the kids.  However this is by far the best cookware we have every owned.  I never buy anything with first researching the product. I spent hours comparing the various brands of stainless steel cookware based on the various styles of cooking we do.  You name the brand and I more then likely looked at it.  The Chef's Classic Series is every bit as good as the some of the more expensive brands on the market today.  It transfers and holds the heat very well.  It cooks at a fraction of the temperature of lesser quality cookwares.  The handles are comfortable in your hand.   Even filled, they do not feel over whelming heavy but at the same time they have a solid, sturdy feel.  They feel balanced!  Clean up was always a problem with the other stainless steel cookware we owned but not with these.  I'm actually surprised how easily food releases with only minimal oil.  I do not think you would be disappointed if you choose this cookware.
1	Featherweight Lightweight Bissell 3106A vacuum. It's convenient, very lightweight, easy to use and has very good suction.  It is kept handy and used every day to pick up crumbs, dust, etc., on our hardwood floors.  It's very easy to empty the bagless container. We had hoped that this vacuum would have a thicker brush to protect new hardwood floors.  Since it is advertised as a hardwood floor vacuum we assumed it would have a soft brush that would gently touch the wood floor.  Instead, it has hard plastic wheels with a short, firm brush.  It hasn't scratched our new floors yet, but we worry and try not to press down when we are vacuuming the floor
1	Mikasa Iced Tea Spoons. These spoons have a substantial feel in your hand and are of excellent quality for such a low price. The satin finish with shiny edges is a nice complement to my Satin Butterfly Meadow stainless.
1	Looks high quality. I have had many good experiences with the Farberware brand. I ordered this set and it feels like quality. Skip the lower grade sets (even the lower grade Farberware) and go for this set that feels like it'll last for well over a decade
1	Works like a charm and never needs oiling!. This is a great waffle iron. I like the fact that you never have to oil it. Though that also may depend on your batter recipe. I just know that the old iron I had prior to this, did need oiling every other waffle. What a pain and not as healthy.Some have mentioned the alarm is annoying. Personally I prefer it, whatever the sound. I have been known to always forget the last one and burn it to a crisp. Now that's hard to do with this handy little alarm
1	The only knife you need. I'll admit it - I've fallen in love. I first used this knife at a friend's house, and was blown away by the ease of use - the ginger and garlic practically minced themselves. I immediately ordered it, and have been delighted ever since. The handle fits my (small) hand perfectly and is comfortable to use, it cleans in a snap, and it can cut through anything - no more slamming the spaghetti squash down on the table with a hatchet. One of the best purchases I've made - well-worth the money
1	Easy to use. I got this for an apartment with two guys who hate to clean.  I figured if I got a cool gadget that also cleans maybe they will us it.  well, my plan worked perfectly!  not only do they use it in the kitchen, but the bathroom as well.  It does a great job cleaning the floors.  They only thing I would suggest is making sure that you completely vacuum the floor first.  If your floor is heavily soiled (like theirs was) it may take some elbow grease on the first try.  After that keep up is easy
1	Great Universal knife. I really have enjoyed using this knife.  It is a great universal knife.  It is nice to have when one needs to cut through chicken skin for deboning. I also like the design of the handel
1	Best cat toy on the market!. This interactive toy is stunningly effective in motivating the hunting instinct of your kitty!  My two both are spellbound by it and it really gets them racing round till they're panting!Great for exercise and stimulation of indoor cats!I will order this again and again, such a change from the usual toys that they get bored with so quickly
1	Purple Sheers. The sheers are excellent!  The only problem with this order is that there was a mix up in the initial shipping and I received black sheers instead of purple sheers.  However, after a concise email the company quickly took care of sending me the correct sheers and a return label at no cost.  Thank you for taking responsibility for the mistake and working efficiently to correct it!
1	Hamilton Beach TrueAir Plug-In Air Cleaner, Two-Pack. Very cool product... I bought 16 double packs because it was cheaper to just use the unit and the throw it away vs. buying a filter...  These are very good though... I've been using them for the past 5 months and I can definately notice a difference in the air quality.  They really pick up the dust... Which is what I wanted..
1	Fabulous Flowing Chocolate. I recently purchased this item and used it for a party of about 40 people.  I had read the reviews on-line and decided on this one for the price that I wanted to spend.  We had to add a little extra oil at first to be sure that there were no clumps in it when we started the fountain up.  I had read some reviews where some people said the units that they bought were noisy and were only good for about an hour before the chocolate started to clump up.  This model works GREAT! It was relatively quiet also.  The chocolate was still flowing after everyone had left that evening.  We ran it for a good 5 hours and it worked super!  I purchased Nestle Chocolate Chips at the grocery store and followed the guidlines in the book that comes with it.  We melted the chocolate with the added Canola Oil in the microwave before adding it to the fountain.  Clean up was very easy! I can't wait to use it again for our up-coming daughter's college graduation party in May and our wedding in July.  Amazon services are also great
1	the best ever. the thread count is excellent on these egyptian cotton sheets, really something worth considering.  its like sleeping on clouds, in heaven, in the sky, where god lives.
1	OUTSTANDING. Just what I wanted and I need another set.TY FRED LUNDBOR
1	Good little gadget for the price. Like another reviewer, I was skeptical about this, but I wanted a frother to give as a Christmas gift and was willing to risk 20 bucks.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Okay, it's not a fancy automatic steamer/frother, but it does what it claims--creates froth out of milk.  It seems to froth cold milk better than warmed milk, but I've been happy with both.  I didn't have much trouble putting in the batteries, and the stand could seem top-heavy, but we haven't knocked it over.  Only thing I wish could be improved--seems like a lower speed might work a little better--the speed of the frothing tip moves the milk so far to the side of the mug that it spills out.  I've had better success using a wide-mouth "latte mug" than a regular size cup or pint pitcher
1	TO CUTE COOKIE JAR. THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY BOSS WHO IS VERY PICKY AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.  THIS WAS THE PERFECT GIFT.  IT WAS VERY VERY CUTE
1	Nice product. I bought this for my office.  I looks great, and works fine.  It also was received very fast.  I was amazed how quickly I received it.  One issue though; it has one of the most lacking owner's manuals, so be prepared for trial and error.  I know a fridge is not the most complicated equipment, but I had to guess which way the cold adjustment knob was supposed to go to make the fridge colder.  The knob is also down in the back, so if you have to adjust, it is a bit of a reach.  Now that I figured things out, though, I really am pleased
1	toasty review for Sanyo Toasty. The Sanyo Space Saver Toasty is great on saving space and is a good toaster. However it is not the best in using it as an oven to heat up snacks
1	Fabulous little hot water pot!. We love this pot, and keep hot water available 24 hours--nice to grab that lunchtime soup or late-night cup of camomile tea. It is easy to use (pour in water & plug in) and pour (push down on circle which depresses on top of lid). Great value! This was a surprise appliance in the best possible way--never expeccted to like it so much or use it so constantly on the kitchen counter--good looking too! Jil
1	Nice Liquid Soap Dispenser. I like this soap dispenser because:1. it's big and I don't have to refil it often;2. when filled up  with detergent, body lotion or what have you, it gets heavier and won't move when you press the pump;3. the advertised non slip base really works;4. the top part of the pump itself is big enough so that you don't necessarily need your finger to push it (like when you already have a sponge in your hand or something you still can get the pump to work by pressing it with the side of your hand, forearm, etc.);5. the pump is made out of plastic and you won't end up with a yucky, stinky gunk on your hands like you would if the pump were made out of metal;6. has no metal details on the base, so no rusty bottoms that leave nasty ring stains on your countertop;7. it does what it's supposed to do everytime you pump the pump, meaning you get a fair amount of whatever you have inside the dispenser.Simple as that!
1	Great shakers. These are really great shakers.  They're pretty small though so don't plan on serving corn on the cob to 10 people and expecting it to last through the dinner.  They look fantastic on a table display and really add flair to your decorating.  They're functional, but they really could stand to be a little bigger. I'm happy with them though - the plum are just gorgeous
1	It's worth the money. It's a handy gadget to have around the kitchen, and also for cleaning up the toothpaste blobs in the bathroom sink.  My only complaint is that the battery life isn't very long, and I don't like putting disposable batteries in the trash.  I fixed that by getting a universal battery charger and some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  Problem solved
1	Flexible in shape and in color. I bought both of my boys this hamper when I redecorated their rooms.  It goes with anything, and the mesh allows the clothes to breathe between laundry days. I wish it was a bit larger in capacity, but 9 and 11 year old boys seem to get their clothes in there, and when it is full to the top, then they know it's time to bring their hampers to the laundry room.  Also, we plan to bring one with us on vacations now, because it is easy to collapse and pack
1	My wife loves it. My wife loves hot water - for tea and straight.  She was always boiling water on the stove - sometimes forgetting until it all boiled away.  I gave this to her as a gift and she now uses it all the time.  Works great, saves time, saves money.  The cordless feature is great
1	Form and Function. This is a great little timer! Sure, it's not all fancy and digital, but it gets the job done just the same.  And it adds a bit of whimsy to my little kitchen. When I have freinds over for dinner, they comment on how cute it is. The ringer is loud enough that I can hear it anywhere in my  1 level apt.  If you are upstairs or downstairs you might not be able to hear it as well though. If you are looking for a cute, basic timer, this is it :-
1	Great for a Long Winter's nap!. I bought one of these duvet covers and liked it so much I went back and bought another for my mother.  She loves hers, too.  I found the description to be accurate and the fabric to be of high quality.  I would enthusiastically recommend this product, and at this price, it's a steal
1	Best cat toys ever!. My cats don't like to play with many toys, but they love the crackle noise this toy makes.  I had to buy one toy for each cat.  One cat will start playing with it and the other will try to take it away
1	High quality on par with ALL Clad and good for induction stove. After much research and looking at different triply/clad cookware from Henckels, Kitchenaid, Calphalon, and ALL Clad, I decided on Gourmet Standard.  I am very glad I did.  The cookware is beautiful and the stainless steel and aluminum is thicker than all the other name brands mentioned above except for ALL Clad, which I think is a bit thicker.Compared to All Clad, I feel it is a better value in terms of costs and the size of the pans you get.  Cook's Illustrated stated that this cooked just like All Clad.  So Save yourself some money and go with Gourmet Standard. It's also good for induction stoves
1	Item does work however, with patience. The apple slicer blade works nicely.  The large cut french fry slicer works but the secret is to place the large end of the potato under the blade first. Remember, these are manual type cutters that do require patience and safety issues.  I have used my cutters many times and they have not broken.  I am a small frame person with not much strength.  Do not try to slam the blade through the item all at one time.  Potatoes are more dense than an apple.  You have to master the use of these blades and they do work
1	Just what I expected!. The price was right!  The stand looks expensive and does the job!!
1	Allergy  sufferer. This is a great product, I love the Automatic function where it senses the condition of the air and adjusts the fan speed accordingly. Since I placed this in our bedroom the dust accumulation is about 99% gone, we also sleep so much better and feel rested in the morning. I would not hesitate to buy this purifier,again it is made with such outstanding quality and so very quite.
1	No more stink!!. it's a cool little tent... it's cute. keeps the area clean of litter sand and the it doesnt make it smell as bad anymore because there's the door that covers it. Except that the door only close half way. yes, i recommend you to get it..
1	Great Buy!. Does the job and a good buy.  Not a real decorator item, though
1	Sharp Solid Stainless Style. Another beautiful knife from this series.Wonderful balance, solid forge, well built, great edge, stylish, and practical.  Fits nicely in the hand, great contour.  Quite handy when you need a smaller serrated knife
1	Versatile!. Why haven't they come up with this before?  I love this little machine.  I have used this both on the stove top (following all directions, of course) and in the base.  I have yet to use it in the oven, but so far it is doing what the company claims it will do, and that is "versatility!"  It cooks well and I think it's about time that slow cooker companies make their stoneware like this one.  Kudos to Rival!  The only knock is that the lid does not fit very flush against the edges, but it is also stoneware and just as versatile.  So if that is the only knock against it, bring it on! :
1	Nice product, but could be a little more flexible. I have a sort of spatula addiction.  I own far too many spatulas and always buy more looking for the "perfect spatula".  This one is a solidly good spatula.I like that it is wide enough to turn any food that I cook.  It is excellent with delicate food like fish, crab cakes or risotto cakes.   The width of this spatula would make it difficult to use in a tiny pan.  I haven't had any problem with pan size, because I use mostly 10 inch pans and wider.The bottom inch of the spatula is flexible, and after that it is rigid.  This spatula is a little thicker than I would like it to be.  But, if it were thinner it might be too flexible. I would like this spatula to be just a little more flexible.This spatula has been used most days in my kitchen for the last 6 months and so far is showing not signs of wear.  It is holding up better than most of the other nylon spatulas that I have purchased in the past.Overall this is good spatula that I would recommend.
1	welllll not to bad. i purchased this sprayer to us with spray butter, well it does work but a full pump only get a small amount of spray probably because it is so thick but it still sprays better than the plastic bottle the butter comes with, it is easy to pump the bottle so i think it is worth the trouble to me hope this help
1	Love It!. I just received this today and I love it!  It's sure to get tons of use!  Nice clean lines...very pretty.  Great price too!  Thanks Amazon/Target
1	This is my second one!!!. My husband and I love this electric skillet!!  This is our second one - as we over used our first one.  It is the perfect size for cooking breakfast and yet big enough for cooking one dish suppers!  The nonstick finish is great and clean up is a breeze as you can submerse the whole thing (minus the electric plug).  We loved this skillet so much that we searched for this one and could only find it on Amazon!  I have tried another one - but is was to large and took up to much space on my counter
1	Melitta Ready Set Joe Coffee maker. This coffee maker is super!  My office has access to hot water, but not enough space for a traditional coffee maker.  Ready Set Joe, was the answer.  A delicious cup of hot coffee, with just the pouring of hot water. Everything is here, and only takes the space of a coffee mug.  Low tech, high quality, that's how I define it.Joh
1	A Great Knife. You can't go wrong with this knife.  I use it almost as much as I use my 8 inch chef's knife.  It holds an edge well, feels light in your hand, and has perfect ballance.
1	Great Cutting Board. This cutting board is all that it is advertized to be.  I liked mine so much that I went out and bought a smaller version.  Being able to put the cutting board in the dishwasher makes this my favorite cutting board and one that I look forward to using on a daily basis.
1	cool concept for storage and dispensing. I absolutely love cereal and I just had to have this cereal dispenser. Easy to clean and assemble. It is a fun way to display your cereals and know how much it left before you need to purchase more. There have been way too many disappointing moments when I reached for my box and discovered that I only had less than a stale bowl left! I also bought this because it was stainless steel. Note that the base is the only stainless steel part. The lids and the knobs are NOT stainless steel (which I was disappointed to find out) but made out of plastic with a silver-like coating. I'm guessing that it would either fade or peel off with prolonged use.The first cereal I tried it with was my childhood favorite Lucky Charms. Unfortunately, as I turned the knob, some of my oats got crushed by the rubber :( Perhaps I stuffed it too much?! I also think you could use this product for other dried foods like peanuts, trail mix, or seeds and alike, but nothing big like chips or cheese curls which I am certain would get crushed when you turn the knob to dispense.I also find the product a bit overpriced, too. If the lids and knobs were really stainless steel it would have been more worthwhile.  However, I can't exactly complain when there are not too many competitors out there for this "stainless steel" product. For now, its is doable until the latest model comes out ;-)
1	Don't burn the macaroni. I purchased this pot in January, and have used it several times a week since.  I love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications, it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top (grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review).  The pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well, and I looked forward to years of use until I boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles.  The noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking, scrubbing, cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again.  Because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething 8 month old and had very little to do with the pot, I will definatly be purchasing another pot.Overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price, so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch I would totally reccomend it just don't leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over 30 minutes.
1	Super-nice fan ... Moves a LOT of air, nice controls, well-made, great fan!  My only problem with it was I didn't pay any attention to the HEIGHT dimensions and it won't fit in the window that I bought it for. :-(  Only negative is that it's not as quiet as I expected either
1	Really NICE!!!. I am very impressed with this dog bed. It is very thick and has extra padding. The cover DOES come off for cleaning. The zipper is well hidden. The bed is also very in style for those hip puppies :
1	Great pan, but a little on the expensive side.. I love cooking in this pan. I love cooking in cast iron utensils in general of which I have a few (from Lodge). It looks great and cleans well. I don't understand the high price, however. It's just enamel on cast iron. Sure, the colors are attractive but then you don't get the special flavors you get from contact of the food with the iron as you do in the Lodge utensils. It's not some hi-tech product and you cannor really justify the cost. If this is expensive, the rest of the colors at $20 more are prohibitively costly. I can't see myself getting any more of Le Creuset products unless I get them in some special deal (as I did this one) or received them as gift
1	The Best. I have been searching for months to find a cover to fit my large ironning board.  No one carries one.  This is fabulous
1	Calphajon 8 inch non-wtick pan. Typical of Calphalon. The best non-stick pan on the market as far as I'm concerned. Excellent product
1	Sango Nova Brown 4 Piece Hostess Set. The product is exactly what I ordered.  However, the first shipment was not properly packed and arrived broken.  Replacement was prompt with no hassle.
1	Mixed review. I bought one of these wafflers after doing more research than the subject warrants, I'm sure.  My local mom&pop carry this line so I purchased it from them.  The first waffler wouldn't heat up out of the box so I exchanged it - so far so good with the replacement.  This would be a 5-star review if the first unit had worked and if the "Belgian Waffle" recipe wasn't such a waste of supplies.First trial using the recipe booklet's recipe for "Belgian waffles" produced some rather inedible results.  Even my son the Hoover Vacuum thought they weren't very nice: the finished waffles were pale and spongy despite being baked at a thermostat setting of 6.Second trial run using my tried and true "Joy of Cooking" basic waffle produced well-baked if heavy waffles: crispy outsides, tender insides.  The vacuum pronounced them fit to eat and proceeded to tuck away 6 segments or 1.5 total waffles.This morning's recipe used a modified buttermilk waffle recipe from "JoC".  The results were light and crispy, well-browned, crispy on the outside, tender and airy on the inside.  My son got around two entire waffles.Modified recipe:Separate 3 eggs, melt a stick of butter.Whisk the yolks with 1.5c buttermilk.  Toss together 1.5c flour, .5c cornstarch, 1.5t baking powder, .25t baking soda, pinch salt, optional 1T sugar.Beat the eggwhites until stiff but not dry.Using a spatula quickly stir the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture, then quickly add the melted butter and stir until the batter is mostly smooth.  Fold in eggwhites.Make waffles
1	Fine Fiskar Scissors. These scissors work wonderfully.  I had two pairs of large scissors in my kitchen - one with a broken point and neither cut well.  Having used Fiskar scissors before outside my home and finding them great, I decided to buy two to replace my old ones.  The Fiskars not only cut smoothly, but since they are in the kitchen, they sometimes get sticky and dirty from opening packages of sauce, cutting tape, etc. These scissors have a coating on the blades that enable them to be cleaned easily with just a damp sponge, paper towel or brush and a drop of detergent, and they are like new.  No rusty hinges or screws that make cutting a chore like my old ones
1	Excellent Cookware w/ Style. Besides looking nice when hung from a pot rack, this big pot heats up quickly, cooks food effectively, allows for metal utensils to be used, and is simple to clean.  I especially like the long handle on one end and the short handle on the other - makes maneuvering easy.  It is a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it
1	One-touch!. We received this model as a gift from dear friends -- after having cooked rice for decades in a covered saucepan on the range.  This is terrific!  Just put in the rice, salt and water, press down on the start button, and wait for the cook light to go off.  It takes about 20 minutes, just like on the range top, and produces perfect rice -- plus no more guessing, no more checking (and no more occasional overcooked rice as I must admit to when I used the old way in the past).
1	Great Looking / Functioning machine. got the machine about three weeks ago and have since made between 15 to 20 cafe lattes.  first and foremost the machine looks great - primary reason for purchase, as it definitely seemed a great visual piece in our kitchen.  I had read reviews and found nothing that scared me away functionality so went for it.  all in all thus far, we have no complaints.  it 'froth's' low fat milk using the steamer w/ ease and even does a good job w/ low fat soy milk which has to be a good test of a machines steaming capabilities.  the temp gage is great and fully functional.  I like simplicity (especially when it comes to anything requiring ac power) as it typically means less to break down.  the espressione is about as straight forward as can be.note* I have never owned an espresso machine before but used a krups one for about a year while living overseas in a family house.  the espressione is a total step up.  i have an obsessive attention to detail and couldn't find any corners cut w/ this device.  only module that they could have possibly been better w/ is the grounds tray which as listed in other reviews is a bit 'cheap plasticy'.  not a big issue as you can't even see it unless you remove it to clean out the grounds.

1	I love my wok. This wok is so far the best one that I have ever had.  It is truly non-stick easy to clean & the glass-domed lid is a really nice touch, which gives the wok a very classy look.I am addicted to cooking most of my meals in this wok from salmon fillets to one-pot family meals.I highly recommend this wok with no doubt!Bygbab
1	DVD/CD Storage. Beautiful wood tone, would blend with any dark furniture. Can be stacked on top of each other, or side by side looks really nice. I am a short woman; therefore, stacking would not work. Picture does not do justice to produce. Am extremely satisfied and shipment was unbelievably fast.
1	Mr Coffee. This is the perfect size coffee maker for an apartment or camper. I have one in both
1	The best flavor. Both of my dogs found carrot to be their favorite flavor over cheese, bacon or any of the others.  Yeah carrot is best.  It was 2 different types of dogs too one pug and one shepheard mix.  This must taste really good and they must like the mild sweetness.  He also likes real carrots and pulp from the juicer.  Yeah carrot is that good.  I go easy on the carrot pulp from the juicer because it is so fibrous.
1	Sunflower Minidisk Pitcher. It is adorable. We had a large picture just like this when I was a child so this is a special reminder of it. The minidisk pitcher is just the right size for an individual syrup pitcher for pancakes. I would love to have one in every color
1	Great Juicer @ Times/Manual don't describe Trick of Cleaning. REVIEW:----------------- This Juicer is a Great juicer, and if you know the ""Trick"" to cleaning it, well its a snap and makes this juicer a realy great Juicer.---------- First off, it is very quiet while juicing, and is juices very smoothly, no shimmying across counter top, like some customers have stated of other juicers. It does not foam up, and I have been able to juice over a gallon of juice, with only having having to spend 40 second to lift out baket, scoop out the pulp, and reassemble the juicer, before you are off again.-------- The citrus fruit juicer attachment, which is included at no extra cost, is well made with two sizes to juice large and small citrus fruit. It has safety features that will insure safe opperation while juicing citrus fruit, (some other brand juicers, will require you to purchase the juicer attachment at an additional price). The citrus fruit stainer is so great, you could can juice boxes of citrus fruit, while only having to stop and empty the citrus strainer after every about 30 medium peaces of citrus fruit.-------------------------------------For cleaning, it comes apart very quickly, without any difficulty, there is only two peices too take apart from the base unit.-----------------------------------------After spending many hours of researching the specs of different juicers out there. Then reading several customer reviews for many of the juicers sold by Amazon.com. I decided to purchase this KitchenAid Juicer.---------------------------------- And there was only one negative review concerning the KitchenAid Dual Function Juicer, about difficulty cleaning small food out of strainer, THERE IS A SIMPLE TRICK TO CLEANING!!! ------------------------------------ First off, the "Shaped Spatula", looks like part of the packing material, and was almost trashed, lucky I have always insisted, all packing materials are saved, and not put into the trash. Because if you loose this special shaped spatula, you might as well forget about cleaning this juicer.-----------------------------------TRICK TO CLEANING: Take the basket & the special designed spatula. Using the shorter size of the spatula scrap / scoop the left over fruit material out of the strainer basket.----------------------Then use the specially designed spatula's shorter side to scrap with on the outside of the basket. it will fit pefectly. Then put it under running water, and scrape the outside of the strainer basket, it will scrap off the the pulp that is stuck through the micro screen basket. As you turn the strainer and scrape under the running water, you will see how easyly the strainer basket is cleaned.................. Then repeat the process on the inside of the strainer basket while under runing water. Once you see the pulp clean from the strainer basket's inne sides. --------------- Then the next step is to cup your hand under the strainer, (vertical held), while the water is running. Since the pulp floats in water, the slight remaining pulp will float in the pool od water you have created, Then slightly tilt the stainer, and the floating pulp will float over the rim and out of your stainer. Leaving the strainer fairly clean. Repeat the prpocess as needed.---------------------------------------I am juicing 4-5 times each day, sometime as much as a gallon of juice at a time. It cleans quickly and juicer quickly and quietly. I am very happy with this product!!! I strongly recomend this item.Jef
1	Love it!. I have small children and I like being able to use the sanitizing steam on the floors which is nontoxic. The pads are cotton and should not be dried in the drier because, as other people have mentioned in their reviews, they will shrink. I think the cinch strings should be a little longer and the pads made slightly bigger to accomadate for easier application on the mop. Otherwise, I love the mop and the ease of use and it really cleans well.
1	Black Fabric Shower Curtain. Very pretty... simple and elegant for your black and white bathrooms.
1	I waited too long to buy this. This immersion blender is so easy to use!  I can't believe I lived without it.  I have spent 30 plus years using mixers and blenders that don't do half the job this immersion blender does.  It is especially great for pureeing hot soups.  I used to do this with my regular blender and blew the top off.  Now I have no problem with hot or cold items. This item also works well to make dips, smooth mashed potatoes or smoothies.  It is also easy to clean up.
1	Works pretty well ...  except. I have three cats and bought this to keep one of them away from my door.  It works very well on two of them but the one I wanted to deter is a Siamese.  If you read the fine print it does state it might not work on some exotics.  It also won't work if your cat has hearing problems.  For all others it is great
1	amazon has saved my coffee maker. I loved it and I have found more things to buy from amazon. I thought amazon is only for books and music. I was wrong. I am a regular coffee drinker and I can't afford to skip one. I couldn't find the Krups 12-Cup Carafe from the manufacture's web site and were planning to trash my coffee maker for good. Fortunately, amazon has saved my coffee maker. Thank You amazon
1	great filter, great price!. I have owned this filter for many years and I have to say it is great. I have owned others that were good to just as good, but because of the price, this one beats them out
1	I love this kettle!. When a cup of tea sounds wonderful, you won't have to wait long for it.  Water heats very quickly, and  with the automatic shut-off, you won't have to worry about it boiling dry.  The very thin base is also great; it's almost invisible when the kettle is sitting on it, and is not cumbersome.  I purchased the black one and it looks great in my kitchen; and is easily wiped off with a damp cloth
1	Great - if you get good popcorn. Having read the other users reviews of this product, I was not really interested in buying it.  So many of them complained of rough, soggy, chewy or bad-tasting popcorn.  My brother picked up one of these for the holidays, swung by the Fresh Market and got some very good/fresh gourmet popping corn.  Used some butter/oil topping and wow - it was unbelievably good!  I asked to borrower his popper to try at our house and stopped off at the grocery.  Grabbed some Orville Redenbaucher oil and corn.  Terrible.  Worst popcorn I had ever tried.  I went back to the grocery with the corn and returned it.  One of the managers mentioned that since the advent of microwave corn, the stores rarely move the old kernel-style corn.  Said that it could be literally years old, since there is no real shelf-life expiration.  I went to another whole foods type store, bought some organic "black" popping corn and used the same oil as before - fantastic!  Unfortunately I think this item is going to get panned on here by many users because the corn they are using in the popper is simply old.  Not sure where one would go to find it fresh other than maybe a boutique supermarket, but for what its worth, this product is great when used with great popcorn.  When you use lousy corn, its very lousy
1	good to have one at home. Nice little toaster with good price.  Just be careful it can get really hot when toasting.
1	Great single malt glasses. Excellent quality for this hard-to-find specialty glassware.  Available in a nice size set
1	A Chef in the Making. This kit is very durable, and my daughter loves it.  The hat is velcro and can be sized appropriately.  The fabric is thick enough for good durability and washing.
1	Great Quality, Excellent Value. These stools are very sturdy and well worth the price.  The cushion material is a little plain but overall, they provide excellent quality at an unbeatable price
1	Corelle Lifestyles Pewter Dishes--20 pc set. I ordered the dishes and love the plates and bowls.  They are light-weight and don't take up much room in my cabinet.  They aren't gray or pewter colored, they're more of a tan to brown color.  I like the pattern.  I am, however, disappointed in the mugs. They are a great size and look beautiful but are very heavy--approximately 14 ounces each. I have other stoneware mugs about the same size that are much thinner and weigh a lot less, making it easier to hold and drink a full cup of coffee
