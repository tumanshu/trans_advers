0	dvd purchase. the dvd came in a timely manner, packaged well and I have had no problems with the item. It seems to be in great condition
0	What's up with that?. I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show
0	Last Stand at Saber River. We never got to see the movie as both copies of this DVD that we ordered had problems and would not play on any DVD player we owned.  Amazon.com was very kind in crediting us for both bad copies and even gave us a coupon for a discount on a future purchase for our inconvenience.  (Great customer service!)  You might like to know that we found a copy of this movie at a local retailer and it would not work either.  Maybe it's a manufacturing defect.Thanks for asking.  It's nice to be able to voice an opinion.

0	could not be viewed!. i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money
0	Not the Worst Movie Ever Made. First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was "Autumn in New York", but that is a different review.No, this not a great movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie, bleak.More interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until "The Stand" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again (although he probably made some money from "Weekend at Bernies" I & II).Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am only buying it to complete my 80's collection.

0	Imitation of Life by John M. Stahl. This is Lana Turner and full cast best film I have ever seen. This was my Father's most favorite film and am I desperately wanting it. Please help me find it. Thank
0	Just about what I expected, only more boring... I'm sorry, I love Gina Gershon and I was looking forward to watching this movie since I do like action films. But this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick. I wasn't even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show.The basis of this movie - the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an Aryan militia becomes prominent nearby. It starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate, and the white boys in the militia don't like that. *gasp, I never would have guessed*Main character kicks everyone's behind, gets the girl, acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any B flick action film.Your time could be better spent watching paint dry. Or if you're desperate for something like this then watch Universal Soldier, at least it was funny
0	2 1/2 stars !  this is not the worst gore film eva made but not as good as expected!. Lamberto Bava's "Demons 2" just doesn't quite live up to the classic status of the original. The quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way !THE GORE IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THESE KIND OF CULT FILMS! "Demons 2" lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original "Demons" such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet! While not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations,especially considering the two maestro's who held the reins (Argento & Bava!)
0	Monotone, mediocre instruction. The level of detail in the instuction varies widely; some asanas are almost painfully dissected, others seemingly glossed over. Also, instruction is delivered in a very serious-sounding monotone. I would recommend the Yoga Zone tapes over these
0	Embarassing performance by Szeryng... ...make no mistake, I'm a big fan of Szeryng...however, he had a reputation of occasionally having one or more cocktails before a performance...and in this video he appears to be lit up like a Christmas tree and the result is sloppy and demeaning
0	Yeah Right. Ok, so I am not a big vampire movie fan, so maybe that had something to do with the fact that I thought this movie sucked. But I am always open minded to all sorts of films, so I thought I would give this one a whirl. It started out with some potential, but within the first 20 minutes I knew it was going to be hopeless. I should have just turned the darned thing off. It was so unrealistic (ok, I know it's a vampire movie, so what did I expect) but I just didn't believe that the main character (Kerr) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie. And then the girl (Izabella Miko) who had about 8 lines in the movie; that was just lame and pointless. She must have felt like such a loser telling people, yeah, I'm in this movie "The Forsaken", and I'm in it almost the entire time...but....ahhh....well just call me zombie girl. Anyways, I highly recommend a pass on this one, unless you are a complete vampire fanatic

0	Desperately depressing Dalton disaster. This is possibly the most miserable, gloomy film Timothy Dalton has ever made.  He plays the King of Piedmont, who develops an inexplicable passion for a rather tiresome French countess.  She, however, is devoted to her rather wet husband and wants nothing to do with the King, which shows from the beginning that she has deplorable taste.  However, her husband's family want her to give into the King because he is making everyone's lives a misery moping about, and when in the end she realises even her husband wants her to give in to him, she agrees to become the King's mistress.  She proceeds to revenge herself on her husband's family by having them banished to their family estate, but keeps her husband around to act as a lackey. Although the King is crazy about her, she still insists she doesn't love him, until in the end he loses his temper and gives her a black eye.  While I don't in the least blame him, I feeel it would have made a more interesting scene if he had walloped her on a different portion of her anatomy.  She persuades the King to get involved in a war with France, then gets ill with smallpox.  Even after he has risked his life nursing her through the disease, the ungrateful bitch still doesn't love him, what a cow.  Then she runs off with her wimpy husband, and the King is reduced to sniffing her underwear.  It all ends miserably for everyone, in the pouring rain (it never seems to stop raining in Piedmont).  I have no idea whether this preposterous film is based on true events, and if so how accurate it is, but the goings-on in Piedmont make the English monarchy look positively sane by comparison

0	Sentimental and fake. Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself.
0	BOOORIIIIIING!!!!!. I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK!After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL.I FEEL CHEATED!
0	Beneath the Glotz. The story, or rather the spirit beneath the schlocky presentation of SOLARBABIES is rather wonderful.  It must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism.  The kids are not following a glowing ball, they are following an ideal, a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it.  The water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos.  Most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment, most of us have lost sight of that 'sphere of light'.  It's unfortunate that even the movie's director did not understand these meanings, nor did the producers nor the more famous, and over-paid of the two writers.  Consequently they all worked too hard to create another B-science fiction movie.  This movie could have been a classic
0	Beware of Unbox!!!. Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for
0	very disappointing. The movie is vulgar and not meant for children.  It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor.  Not enjoyable at all.
0	Mansfield Park. Anyone basing their understanding of this Austen novel on this movie alone will be misled.  Perhaps the director or producer wanted to make the film "relevant" to today's "hip" audiences (which don't understand anything sophisticated).  While the film was helpful to me in establishing the characters prior to my reading the book itself, I found that the novel has none of the raciness or even some of the scenes that are found in this film.  As is often the case, viewers will find that "the book is much better than the movie."  The acting is fine, but what the actors are asked to act is not faithful to how the real story unfolds.

0	Same Thing. The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers
0	Low-Class, Low-Budget and Low on Titillation, a Pointless Women-in-Chains Howler Now on DVD. The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. It's a grade-C howler but not as blatantly funny as I was hoping. Directed by exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and small-time drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape but shackled together a la "The Defiant Ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.Meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for Lee who stole $40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. Since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra
0	I Can't Buy Into It. Amanda Pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity, but otherwise this film did nothing for me. A bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests? I can't even relate. And they're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness? Yeah right! See it if you're a big fan of fart jokes, or whatever..

0	once again a king story is ruined on film. in the short story collection night shift, mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of(this mess,trucks( twice once by king as "maximam overdrive" and once as a t.v. movie),night surf,the boogyman(not the new one),graveyard shift,the mangler,and maybe more and not one has been done right! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve "he who walks behind the rows"more like "we steped in something behind the rows" and we steped in this flameing piece of junk!!! skip it!!!!!!
0	Dreadful. I recall this movie fondly--Unfortunately, the DVD quality is so poor, this cannot be watched.  Pity Amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings.  Don't waste your time until someone cleans this up.  But it makes a nice coaster, though
0	Cheesy Sci-Fi flick only has *some* good things to offer, but its really silly... Josh Charles (S.W.A.T., Tv's Sports Night) finds out that he is the bearer of a key that can make you travel into different dimensions. Andrea Roth brings him to her friend, played by Rutger Hauer (The Hitcher, Sin City) who guides Charles and tells him that his father was a timedimensional warrior and that he could be too as well. On the evil end, baddie Stuart Wilson (No Escape, The Mask of Zorro) wants the key and the septer that goes along with it so he can fuse worlds together and be the ruler and what not and the trio must bring back the septer to the right place before evil hands get on it and the fate of the world is at risk. Interesting idea is squandered by sillyness and dumb dialouge and some pretty crummy acting, altough Charles saves this from being a total disaster. It's good to see Hauer not being a bad guy but he's wasted along with Wilson. AND, well, it was surprising to see Jack Black (School of Rock, King Kong) in this movie...one before he became famous. Black does his mannerisms and speech. Watch it once and then dimension jump the hell out of the room.
0	Basic Incompetence By Everyone Across The Board!. This movie should be shown to classrooms of aspiring screenwriters and directors as an example of how not to be sucked into the Hollywood junk machine. The screenwriter of this movie obviously had some ideas about a coherent story that he wanted to tell about moral relativity and corrupt military officials. This film's story structure is mostly influenced by the classic film Rashomon. Well, so what happened? How did this ungracious disaster of a movie make it to the big screen? The biggest culprits are easily the movie stars, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, using their bloated star egos to force the screenwriter to rework his material into something they ultimately found more suitable to their star personas. Disgusting! Travolta was supposed to be a bad guy and Jackson was supposed to bite the bullet, but no way would the two Hollywood jerks allow that!SPOILER ALERT: Who in their right mind was surprised by the ending? I knew Sam Jackson was in on it from the get go and soon enough he would grace us with his presence. Lo and behold, his bald head emerges at the end of the movie wearing a white outfit like an angel of some sort. I hate this movie, it's an insult to the audience! John McTiernan, ( Predator, Die Hard ), the director of Basic should be ashamed of such a lackluster effort on his part. But what could he do when faced with the two morons who played the leads! A sad joke of a movie, avoid it unless you just love junk
0	I would have picked zero stars but it wasn't an option. First of all, the only reason I started watching this movie was because my roommate got it and we're both lovers of the Romantics. The only reason I kept watching this movie after the first 5 minutes was because I could already tell it was going to be completely and totally awful and would make for a few good laughs between the two of us.Beyond some very basic facts about the party of writers, this movie is not grounded anywhere in reality. The acting is way overdone and quickly becomes grating. There is no plot whatsoever to speak of and the movie lacks any sense of clear direction or purpose -- it is simply a collection of random, inexplicable, and nonsensical events filled with frenzied sexuality, animalism, and vaguely-defined hallucinations. While I'm sure the actual experience was not entirely tame and prudish, I find it hard to believe that this is anywhere close to being accurate. Even when it tries to delve into pseudo-philosophical discussion about the nature of love, fear, poetry etc., that you would expect to emerge among these great literary figures (which, strangely, does not happen often)it utterly fails to make any understandable conclusions or statements and their real views, beliefs, and visions become hysterical ravings rather than the passionate philosophies that they were.The film does not deal fully at all with Mary's creation of the Frankenstein story, nor do any of the other characters write ghost stories as Byron challenges them and as really took place. The idea that the story was born out of Mary's personal fears is an interesting one but this too spirals out of control and has almost nothing to do with Frankenstein.The premise behind this disaster of a movie is a good one and I think with the right script, actors, and director it could be an amazing exploration of authorship, literary exploration and exchange, and this fascinating group of writers. That is not, however, what this film is.P.S. If you do get seduced by the other reviews, pay particular attention to the scenes in the billiard room...I didn't know they had light bulbs in 1816!
0	Poor History and a screenplay over-dramatic. I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it

Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show
0	a propaganda film gone wrong. This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Barbet Schroeder's film, a "self-portrait" of the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, generated much controversey and even death threats. Idi Amin himself demanded that Schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in Uganda.The film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to Amin.The DVD only has an interview with director Barbet Schroeder for a special feature, although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter Amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes.This film has significance, but is not a good one

0	How much is that demon in the window.... Ohh no, please Mr. Corny demon-thing, don't hurt me!  This movie just seemed to really suck.  While it did scare me (mainly because the only thing scary about this movie was the monster's growl, then you see the  monster and feel better) it still stunk of usual smell of B-rated monster  flicks.  Watching such flicks is almost a hobby of mine, and I'd have to  say, in a triple threat match among this monster (whose name is forgotten  or not even mentioned), Rawhead Rex, and Grim (from the similarly named  film), I'd say Rawhead would go all the way, but going back to the movie,  It was pretty cheesey what with all the ho-hum acting, ho-hum story, and  ho-hum characters.  I advise you to stay away from this movie.  Just ignore  it and maybe it'll go away
0	Ok. But no charm. Lorna is pretty, and her suitor is devoted. The story holds your attention. For many that is enough. Some auspicious beginnings, without depth. So maybe 3-stars for some people. I give 2-stars, if I do not keep it to watch again in later years.I found the romance unfulfilling, and so the movie. Romance movies that I liked better are: "North & South", "Pride & Prejudice"-1940, & 1996 & 2006, "Wives and Daughters", and "A Walk to Remember". Adventure with romance: "The Scarlet Pimpernel".
0	Sad to see Laurel &amp; Hardy in decline. In this 1944 MGM comedy directed by Sam Taylor, Laurel &amp; Hardy are the chef and butler who foil a plot by enemy agents to poison the young exiled King Christopher (David Leland).  On the one hand &quot;Nothing But Trouble&quot; spends time developing the boy-king's growing love for the joys of common democracy, such as playing football.  Then we have the comic sequences in which Laurel &amp; Hardy wreck a dinner party, try to take a steak away from a hungry lion, and end up on the ledge of a skyscraper.  Clearly the boys are getting too old for this kind of stuff.  Not as bad as &quot;The Big Noise,&quot; but too close for comfort. Watching this one will only make you feel sad and not in a good way
0	A movie about nothing. I purchased this DVD with my eyes wide open, because I had been forwarned by reviewers I respect, and I still place Dylan's 1977 "Renaldo and Clara" near the top of my most pretentiuos doo doo list. But wait, that was almost 30 years ago and this movie stars Jeff Bridges AND John Goodman (the Dude abides), also Jessica Lange, Giovanni Ribisi, Val Kilmer, Bruce Dern, Mickey Rourke and was co-written and directed by Larry Charles of Seinfeld and Friends fame, so how bad could it be?Well I planned on watching it one night but after about 30 minutes became fatiqued and fell asleep. This went on for about 3 more nights until I finally finished the movie. The week before I had watched the uncut "Heaven's Gate" (nearly 4 hours), a deliberate slowly paced film, in one sitting, and yet "M and A" seemed so much longer. I also skipped watching the few deleted scenes (something I can't remember ever doing), and went straight for the "Making Of" and watched and listened to those involved talking about the great script and a movie I can't remember seeing.I realize now that deleted scenes would be overkill since the entire movie seems like it's just a bunch of strung together deleted scenes. This is not to say the movie is unwatchable, I had kept coming back to it night after night, in fact there are some very entertaining and surreal moments in the film, I just wish there had been more of them. For starters I would have liked to have seen more of Ribisi, for he was the most focused in his part (though it also seemed like he was in another movie), they could have beefed up the Christian Slater-Chris Penn bits or even made them the main characters and created a sort of Abbott and Costello Meet Jack Fate. Val Kilmer was great, but he disappeared too soon, and some of the songs Dylan did with his band were pretty good, but they could have given the young girl (Tinashe Kachingwe), who stole the show singing "The Times They Are A-Changin'", more of Dylan's songs to sing.The best part of the film for me was Jeff Bridges as a Dudesque reporter asking Dylan's Jack Fate lots of bizarre questions, in fact a short that just edited together all these bits would be enjoyable.I guess that's most of the good stuff, but on the other hand, I wish they had removed the entire subplot concerning his dying father (Richard Sarafian) Angela Bassett, and Mickey Rourke, and despite old man makeup, his father still looks younger than Bob (things must have been pretty bad in prison).Less of Lange and Goodman would have made it less irratating, and Luke Wilson and particularly Penelope Cruz should have ended up on the cuttingroom floor. I'm not sure what to make of Ed Harris in black-face except that I felt like he was a refugee from some old Fellini film.Bob Dylan acts like he sings which isn't so bad in a film where  many of the other actors are so over-the-top, and watching him is like looking at an abstract painting, it doesn't ever change but you keep looking at it to try and find some inner meaning.This is Larry Charles first film and judging by his TV work you would have expected it to be at least funny, but where "Seinfeld" was supposed to be a TV show about nothing but was actually about alot, this movie really is about nothing

0	Noooo! Make it stop!. It seems like a good idea... 'Las Vegas Hillbillys,' a kind of a 'Krush Groove' for the possum pie and moonshine set, starring Jayne Mansfield and Mamie van Doren.  Duelling blonde bombshells, right?  Ah, no.  Van Doren is looking sad and puffy in this film as a 'tough' but disinterested saloon singer, longing for better days when she was straining angora sweaters and scratching out the eyes of good girls everywhere.  Jayne Mansfield sports a series of tentlike grandma dresses of the sort later found adorning the fashionable Weezie Jefferson, reading from cue cards with a kind of breathy, clueless abandon which is probably quite fetching when she's not dressed in a potato sack.  One can imagine her on her rendezvous with destiny, thinking, 'Oh no, we're about to slide underneath that semi truck!  But at least I won't have to think about 'Las Vegas Hillbillys' anymore.'  Between the two of them, they don't get more then seven minutes' screen time.  This movie is ostensibly a musical, in the sense that there is music in it, consisting of fifteen- or twenty-minute blocks of bad lip-synching (in an 85-minute film) which do nothing to advance the plot, such as it is.  Watch for Bill Anderson's all-KGB-agent backup band. 'We are American high-fashion models.'  I gave this movie a whole two stars because they *can* sing, after all... give them a break.  Richard Kiel makes a surprise appearance as, can you guess? a thug.  He actually has dialogue in this film, of a sort, and in watching his performance you really get a sense that unenthusiastically bunny-hopping between cable cars in 'Moonraker' represented the pinnacle of his acting career.  The plot: Woody Weatherby contemplates stardom, inherits a debt-ridden saloon from his uncle, goes to Vegas, tries to run the place, has a twenty-minute nap.  In the last ten minutes Aunt Clem magically fixes everything and starts a cream pie fight.  Van Doren kisses Ferlin Husky, thereby completing her descent to the innermost circle of Hades.  The End.  There was supposedly a sequel to this, 'Hillbillys in a Haunted House,' but I frankly am afraid to watch it.  Be my guest
0	That breeze ain't an open window. Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment
0	A good ole Rebel, New Orleans. I will not watch the movie "Andersonville" until they make a movie called "Elmira"(the camp in Elmira, N.Y., the worst of the Union prison camps had 35% death rate)
0	Movie is great, but Unbox is uncooked. Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it
0	Better not shown. I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better
0	Didn't Emanuelle used to involve mostly eroticism?. If you want erotica then this isn't the Emanuelle film for you.  Yes, there are a couple of so-so love scenes, but the one lesbian scene is pratically non-existent, and the obvious focus of this one is the blood and gore content.  I expected more erotic content, and instead got mostly gruesome scenes that I didn't particularly expect.  Remember that scene in &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; where a nude Bo Derek was tied up and bathed by native women?  That scene was erotic.  Nothing like that one this video
0	plot holes. The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed
0	Survivor Rip Off. I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	Please not another season of this!. Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped

0	Amazon.com likes to take my money. this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave
0	Dont get "Fiji" final week ... Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show
0	Great play, miscast Cyrano and a dull, flat English translation. "Cyrano" is one of the greatest verse plays ever written.Unfortunately Gerard Depardieu is no Cyrano.  He's a great, clumsy side of beef, not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of Hercule Sevanien Cyrano de Bergerac.  With the best will in the world, his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance.The English translation was especially commissioned for this film.  It is undistinguished, prosy and dull.  It has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great American actor Walter Passmore.Get the Jose Ferrer version.  This one's a dog
0	Harriet is good, but the rest of the film...... I gotta give it to that little girl who plays Harriet in the movie. She did a great job. But, I found Rosie O'Donnell's performance really lacking. Which made the film a little boring to watch at times.
0	AMAZON SUCKS. I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!
0	Poor support. This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet
0	The Legend Exceeds The Reality. I have always been an avid fan of Westerns in general, and Charlton Heston in particular, but this is one of those movies where the legend surrounding it far exceeds the actual viewing, even allowing for its having been butchered by the studiosCharlton Heston of course, plays Major Dundee, a man with a very forceful character - resolute, determined, and even rebellious ("invading" Mexico and attacking the French army).  For such a man to later be found as a hopeless drunk wallowing in the gutters of Durango is thoroughly incomprehensible.The purpose of the "invasion" of Mexico is to capture or destroy the Apache Indian, Charriba, so one would expect the audience to watch the movie in anticipation of a great climax when the two sides finally meet.  When they do meet however, the action is over in less than a minute, and Charriba is simply shot by Michael Anderson Jnr.  So the climax is, in my view, an anti-climax.We are then presented with a new climax, when Dundee and his men have to defeat the French army in order to get back across the Rio Grande.  Although this encounter is a lot more exciting than the one with the Apaches, the overall effect, as far as I am concerned, is rather like the effect one gets when reading a murder mystery to discover that the murderer is somebody who only entered in the final pages (and the scene where a wounded Richard Harris single-handedly takes on the other half of the French army is so unexpected in view of what has gone on before, as to be virtually unbelieveable).With regard to the movie having been heavily cut by the studios, I would suggest that if any cuts had to be made, they should have cut the Durango scenes entirely, plus all of the scenes featuring Senta Berger.  Romance only slows down the action and adds nothing to the story, whilst too much romance leads to boredom.Finally, having watched the movie with the new score first, and then with the original score, I have to say that I preferred the original.The movie opens with Charriba saying to an upside down strung-up soldier, "Who are you going to send after me now?"  The original then has the opening title, "Major Dundee," accompanied by the Mitch Miller Sing Along Gang singing the Major Dundee March.  To me this is a much more stirring and rousing score than the new replacement, and sets the scene for what one hopes will be an exciting movie.By all means buy this dvd as a piece of movie history, and as part of either a Charlton Heston or Sam Peckinpah collection (even though Peckinpah disowned it), but for my money don't expect a Western anything like as great as the likes of The Big Country, The Magnificent Seven, or How The West Was Won.
0	Can't bring myself to say more. I love a good action movie.  Love them.  So what weent wrong?  Well, the effects were there, but it all seemed so detached.  We may have seen most of the action sequences you can do on a ship previously, or we may not.  Bottom line is this:  if you are going to have an action sequence, make it exciting.  Watching the DVD of this, I wasn't able to be drawn in sufficiently to keep me from checking my email.  At less than 100 minutes in length.A boring action movie is just plain wrong, and that's what Poseidon is.
0	Goodtimes Dvd = Bad Picture Quality. After reading a couple of other reviews about the &quot;quality&quot; of transfer on this dvd, I decided I wanted this in my collection. What I THOUGHT would be good or atleast a decent enough picture quiality, I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED.THE QUALITY OF TRANSFER OF THE PICTURE IS HORRIBLE!!! A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered. Picture tones are very, very bad, along with what little color that is desplayed. Almost a black &amp; white picture with most of the entire movie too dark to make out what is going on. Even with my brightness turn all the way up on my tv, it still was so dark it almost wasn't worth continue watching.The ONLY things positive on this dvd was the fact it was in widescreen and &quot;suppossedly&quot; in Dolby Digital EX. The beginning Dolby intoduction was deffinatly in Dolby and had good sound but the movie itself didn't distributeand Dolby sounds that I could make out on my theatre sound system. Sounded like mono to me.Thsi dvd reproduction stinks and I suggest those that are into quality dvd and getting you money worth saty away from this &quot;Goodtimes Video&quot; version untill it is put on dvd correctly. Why they botherd is beyond me. Because I wanted to have a copy of this movie in widescreen, I am taping it on to VHS for my collection and going to try and return it for something better tommorrow. I suppsoe I'll have to be content that I got the widscreen version on VHS for now untill they re-release it on dvd with better quality, or they show it on tv in widescreen which I highly doubt. Heck, even TAPING IT OFF TV YOU'D GET A BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN THIS DVD
0	Disappointing in more ways than as a remake. It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so
0	Terrible. I used to like this film back in the late 80s but after purchasing it, reading the book and watching it again I realized that there isn't much to say that is redeeming of this film. Sure it's low budget, but the story and characters are so cheesy and NOT in a good b movie way. I guess this film will still have it's fans but after reading the book (I dont normally compare books to films because its downright impossible to compare) I found the characters just not that likeable and the ending is very ridiculous. For a film to achieve cult status isn't too hard if its a b movie but whether its a good film or not is the real question. As for me I rate this low because I find it atrocious but for it's fans, the ones out there that REALLY love this film and call it a "classic" I must say I hope some day they remake the story with better actors, effects and plotting
0	Sickening. After seeing this film, I am pretty amazed they have been able to put what they did on to a dvd. I actually felt sickened by the images I saw and had to turn it off many times. Yes its an interesting documentary but can you imagine how the victims family felt knowing the images of their loved one being violently stabbed were being shown to people? Personally, I think you've got to have a strong stomach to watch it
0	Shameless Rip-Off. Shameless rip-off of "Jungle Taitei" ("Kimba the White Lion") by Tezuka.  Any anime lover can tell.  (Similarities in characters, scenes, and story lines are unbelievable.)  Disney's response?  "Never heard of Kimba."  Oh, purleese.  I'm kicking myself for paying Disney for this piece of swindle
0	Very boring. I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love
0	Ambrose Bierce is a Better Authority. I have rented this video for the sake of a trip down Memory Lane. Of course, fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility. I hated this video for its teaching of American ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable. For example, in
0	Chairman William Shatner? Be Afraid! Be Very Afraid!!!. Between 1993 and 1999, a popular television show in Japan called "Iron Chef" ("Ryori no tetsujin") pitted its acclaimed one of its professional chefs against a challenging chef each week using a particular theme ingredient in all of the dishes made.  The show was hosted by the flamboyant Chairman Kaga (Takeshi Kaga) who opened each show, presented the challenger, unveiled the theme ingredient and gave a brief synopsis before the winning chef was declared. The show gained popularity in syndication in the U.S. on the Food Network using a mixture of dubbed English and subtitles.Due to the rising popularity of the show from cable subscribers, the UPN TV network decided to broadcast an American version of the show in 2001 that was produced by the Larry Thompson Organization and Lions Gate Television of Canada.  Unfortunately, these two companies failed to effectively reproduce the elements of the Japanese show that had made it so popular.  Instead, they created a poorly written & directed substitute that was akin to watching a WWF wrestling match, not a challenge between two professional chefs.The first mistake that the Larry Thompson Organization and Lions Gate Television made was in their selection of the new chairman for "Iron Chef USA".  Though I very much enjoy William Shatner in his roles as Captain Kirk in the original "Star Trek" TV series, T.J. Hooker in the show of the same name and his more recent role as an attorney in "Boston Legal", his attempt at being chairman of "Iron Chef USA" was far too farcical and clownish to be taken seriously in trying to replicate Takeshi Kaga's flamboyance from the original Japanese TV series.  Their next mistake was in the commentaries.  During each of the original Japanese "Iron Chef" shows, a group of commentators (which included a culinary expert) would explain what each chef was doing, as well as analyze the possible dish outcomes.  The "Iron Chef USA" commentators treated the two chefs as if they were athletes and would even send in an annoying "field reporter" (Sissy Biggers) to ask them stupid question while they were busily preparing their meals.  Their other major mistake was their selection of judges.  Most of the Japanese "Iron Chef" shows included an actual food critic as one of the judges, as well as Japanese actors, actresses & sports personalities, who were quite articulate in their critiques of the prepared meals; but the "Iron Chef USA" judges were inarticulate and inexperienced.Not surprisingly (and quite thankfully), only two episodes of "Iron Chef USA" starring William Shatner were ever produced and were entitled, "Iron Chef USA: Showdown in Las Vegas" and "Iron Chef USA: Holiday Showdown".  Each of these shows on the DVD I rate with a well-deserved 1 out of 5 stars for being poor mockeries of the much more entertaining original Japanese version.  In 2004, the Food Network's produced its own version entitled "Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters" that included two of the beloved original Japanese Iron Chefs, Hiroyuki Sakai and Masaharu Morimoto, and was hosted by Takeshi Kaga's nephew, Mark Dacascos.  It was a far better show than the ill-fated 2001 "Iron Chef USA".  If you are considering purchase of the 2001 "Iron Chef USA" DVD, you do so at your own risk
0	You might need to watch this one twice. It starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end.  And about 2/3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion
0	What what what???!!!. I have to wonder what world, what physical plane, what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on? Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick "The Unnamable", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie
0	Poor Reproduction of Great Movies. This is an extremely disappointing copy of 3 great original movies.  Looks as if it was duplicated on poor dvd equipment from old, used VHS tapes.  No wonder it's hard to find out who made this.  I wouldn't want to take credit for it, either.  Hard to enjoy in this poor format. My delivery took place in February, 2006
0	worst Bond movie?. Apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well, nearly unwatchable.What's so bad about it?  Well, how shall I begin . . .(1)  Sean Connery is a dud.  There can be very little doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like he's just going through the motions.  To be fair, he had no decent material to play.  The only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before.  But these are grace notes; by and large, Connery is stiff as a board here.(2)  The action scenes are uninspiring.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes.  Here, the action is strictly second-rate.(3)  Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible performances.(4)  There is literally no reason to see this in favor of "Thunderball," of which it is a remake; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this remake makes ZERO improvements.  In fact, the plot merely becomes muddled.(5)  There are a series of awful performances in supporting roles.  Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief, are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place.  The actor playing the "new" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't very good, either.(6)  The music is bad.  The title song is boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I couldn't care less that the James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's bad, it's what IS there.All in all, I'd have to say that -- unless we're counting the 1967 version of "Casino Royale" -- this is THE worst of the James Bond movies.  It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my opinion
0	Anti-Southern Propaganda. This movies rates right up there with "Schindler's List" . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda.  Fortunately, Ted Turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making "Gettysburg," and the even better "Gods and Generals."If you want to see a real, accurate depiction of the War For Southern Independence (aka, The Civil War), watch "Gods and Generals" or "Gone With The Wind," and stay away from movie garbage like "Andersonville."Also watch for the extended version DVD of "Gods and Generals" coming for the Christmas season of 2005.
0	Lean Pickin's. Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless
0	Dark comedy still needs to have comedy. I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.
0	Eh...I've Seen Worse. If you want a review of the plot itself, complete with spoilers, feel free to read the other reviews.My biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed, again and again, due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn't keep the story straight.There is a homage to Asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm. That would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film. There are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible.That said, it was a bit enjoyable. The cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given. If the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked, maybe I would have cared what happened to them.The dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say, "Oooh, cool".Good premise, good effects, good acting, but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film
0	Disappointing!. What a disappointment.  Seeing Kline, Ronstadt and Smith on the cover, as well as in the description, I believed this was the movie version.  I should have read further through the reviews.  However, the misleading was not necessary. How many have you sold to unsuspecting innocents like me? Even so, I would have enjoyed this, had it been acceptable quality.  The quality is extremely poor, the remastering done very sloppily, the color washed out, and the camera angles leaving one quite distracted from the performance.  AND I paid $18.99, although I see it is being advertised for $17.99.  Thumbs down
0	Sour Note. No wonder they didn't produce any other live action productions of Dr. Seuss books until after his death.  This film gave me a headache.  The direction and pacing of the film is flat, the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring(inexplicably nominated for an Oscar!), the acting was wooden, the sets were garish and ugly.  At least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss works were.  I think Dr. Seuss works best in small doses like the short animated TV shows that were made some thirty-odd years ago.  Do check out the "Gerald McBoing-Boing" cartoon thats included on the disc.  It contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than "Dr. T" does in ninety minutes
0	WHY  AREN'T ZERO STARS AVAILABLE FOR RATING??????. Maybe I should have known better, but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same. This is a four dollar movie in any department store
0	Why the Charge. Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	Jason Takes Your Money. As a general rule, any film with a large number of Roman numerals behind it is going to suck, and the eighth outing of the F-13 franchise, JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, obeys this rule to a fanatical degree. This movie is terrible, an utter embarrassment, and is noteworthy only as a study in corporate greed and marketing deception.By the fourth installment of the series, the ironically titled FINAL CHAPTER, this formulaic slasher franchise was as exhausted as an old, blood-soaked boot. Jason Voorhees had outlived his usefulness and it was time for his rotted a*s to hang up the gaolie mask and retire. But the movie industry is an industry first, and when THE FINAL CHAPTER turned unexpectedly into a cash cow the studio execs at Paramount continued to flog their exhausted serial killer into progidies of meaningless violence. THE FINAL CHAPTER was followed by three more absolutely asinine sequels, which saw Jason improve the Crystal Lake gene pool by slaughtering legions of pot-smoking teenage dimwits. By this time P-mount was beginning to get embarrassed by their deformed, kill-crazy stepchild, yet the lure of an easy payday drew them on.I still remember seeing the preview for this flick in a movie theater back in 1989. The audience ate it up. We actually believed that the producers had decided to tweak the exhausted series by loosing Jason in a place where he would probably feel right at home: the Big Apple. One could only imagine the bloody shennanigans Crystal Lake's least popular citizen could embark upon in New Yawk City! People were laughing out loud as they imagined him loose in the City of Lights. He could slay obnoxious Volcanoites! Teach rude cab drivers the errors of their ways! Annihilate the snotty salespeople at Tiffanys! Cut down on panhandlers! Convince grafitti artists to stay out of dark alleys! Run for mayor! We sixteen year olds LOVED the idea.There was just one problem. The gang at Paramount had no intention of delivering on their promise. The ad campaign, like the title of the movie, was a fraud, and the only thing that got "taken" in this film was the money of a lot of bloodthirsty teenage dupes.First of all, the first 60 minutes of this 90-odd minute movie are not set in Manhattan, but  in Crystal Lake and then on a ship called the Lazarus (get it?) which is conveying the usual cargo of teenage acting-skool dropout slasher fodder on a graduation cruise to New York. Jason, accidentally revived from the depths of the Lake by a jolt of electricity, stows on board the ship and proceeds to ch-ch-ch, ha-ha-ha his way through the doltish grads and the suspiciously small crew until the survivors are pursuaded to take a rowboat to Manhattan Island. Unfortunately "Manhattan Island", with the exception of a couple of second-unit establishing shots, is largely an unimaginative-looking soundstage on the Paramount lot populated by Central Casting New Yawkers, including the usual mixed-race mugger team and an Irish cop who says things like, "Well, ye seem loike foine peeple, so I'll not be arresting ye."There is not a single scary moment in the whole film, and there are not even any particularly interesting kills. Kane Hodder's plodding, rotting, thoroughly over-rated Jason looks almost bored, as if he signed onto the cruise by accident, and then got talked into doing his mass murder shtick by the ship's entertainment director. To make up for the lack of any kind of suspense, the writers threw in a lot of gratuitous pleading for mercy from the female characters, and added nice little moments like a ship's crewmember talking warmly about his baby son right before Jason runs a harpoon through his body. Classy stuff, but really, everything about the movie is stupid, from the crazy deckhand who mumbles prophetically that the voyage is doomed (shades of Crazy Ralph), to the annoyingly cute little dog who has more acting talent than most of the victims. Hell, the climax of the film features a chase through the New York sewers, which, we are told, flood with radioactive toxic waste every midnight. (Does Rudy Guilani know about this?)I realize having expectations for a Jason movie is silly, but even by the cellar-low standards of the franchise, this flick is a ripoff, a fraud, a dreadful fake, utterly stupid, appallingly bad, useless, terrible, and horrible. ZERO STARS.
0	What's up with that?. I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show
0	UnBox video not yet working. Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200
0	OOOOH rotoscope. Big deal. Who cares!!!. That part alone was not a redeeming factor for the film. I'm not going to even get into the fact that the actors performances were dull to say the least, or that the plot from beginning to end was lackluster. I actually wasted $3.99 renting this schlock on ON DEMAND. Boy, do I want my 4 bucks back. Basically, all this movie was about was five crackheads running around playing crackhead games. If I wanted to see that, I could have saved my money and walked around the corner. Furthermore, I could have got a camcorder and made a movie about a bunch of fiends sitting around the house babbling about nonsense for two hours!! Would have saved millions. To sum up, I would like to advise folks to please avoid this as if it was the Ebola virus!!
0	POOR QUALITY. THE SOUND IS BAD. I HAVE TRIED THIS DVD ON 2 DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
0	Better on VHS!!!. This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!!
0	Didn't work. I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up.
0	A Dissenting View. As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory.What I dislike about "Arthur" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in "The Loved One" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey.Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes.

0	Politically correct retelling ruins the message. Although it looks the same as the HG Wells story and the 1960 movie, this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man's nature into a mildly fun sci-fi outing. Alexander's motivation for building the Time Machine is entirely different, and what he learns 80,000 years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind (that is, if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time-travel paradoxes).So the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the George Pal version. We don't even find out anything about what we are about to see!But things get worse is in the distant future. Although the writing tries to dance around the fact -- they have de-fanged the harsh reality of the Eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete. Instead of unknowing sheep, they are new-agey world-culture pluralists. The dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense. And there is no Rod Taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts.The only reason why I give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci-fi films in years, and I found some of the special FX (the moon) and Jeremy Irons, cheesy as they may have been, fun
0	WARNING: Wrong Episode!. This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation
0	THIS gets 4 Stars???. I read all the reviews where everyone said this movie was so hilarious. So I gambled and bought it. Man, this movie really stunk. I mean it's like it could have been funny, but none of the re-dubbing was very funny at all. I watched this movie with some good expectations, but as it droned on and on, it slowly became apparent to me that no laughs were coming. In fact, as I kept watching it I kept thinking to myself, "Geez, even I could dub funnier dialogue into the movie than THIS!"Don't get me wrong; dubbing over a corny Japanese spy movie definitely sounds like it would be very funny. It's an idea that has the potential to be VERY funny. It just wasn't done very well here. Don't expect many laughs from this movie. For most of the movie, no one is even talking at all! You're just watching a bad not-funny movie. But if that's what you like, then by all means, buy it.P.S. By the way, this movie has it's occasional sexually interesting scenes. But you don't ever get to see anything. They've edited-out anything that might have been worth seeing. So not only is it NOT funny, but where the original movie would have turned you on, you are denied that as well. A nitpick to be sure, but it didn't make me like this movie any better.P.S. #2. If you want to go watch something funny, watch "This is Spinal Tap." That movie is truly hilarious. It does not disappoint. It doesn't have anything to do with Woody Allen, but it will wash the bad taste out of your mouth that "What's Up Tiger Lily" is guaranteed to leave you with
0	Firefly: Excellent.  But buy it on DVD, not "Unbox"!. Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.For example, 3c:"Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use??

0	HEY THIS MOVIE SUCKS!. More time could have been spent in Ney York City for this movie. Like with Friday The 13th Part Seven: The New Blood, all of the good gore scenes were cut out. But still, this is a terrible movie and I am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five
0	Same Thing. The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers
0	Unforgettable (Unfortunately). This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die
0	Buyer Beware. I was duped into thinking this was a music performance video. It's nothing but a documentary about the '20s. As a documentary, it's great, but definately not for a music buff (musician), like me, who collects music videos
0	Not happy. This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence
0	A Politically-Correct Melodrama: A Definite Stinker. Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did
0	so-so. I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger Cast this Film would have been interesting.this Film flip flopped Time Periods&it hurt it's cause.I will give Prince Props though for being a Black Film Director back at a time when it was really rare&truth be told in 2004 it ain't that much better on a whole
0	Interesting all-star British adaptation, but DVD transfer is unwatchable. This is a very interesting adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, featuring a plethora of major British actors from the time this movie was made. Note that today's younger audience, weened on an MTV diet of rapid cuts and incredible CGI, may find this slow. But if one can get beyond that, it's most definitely worth a watch.That said, this DVD transfer is basically UNWATCHABLE. It's not clear what source they used for the transfer, but there are TERRIBLE audio pitch problems throughout the movie, with wow and flutter horribly apparent. This is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score. If you have any sense of pitch, you'll find yourself pulling your hair out listening to the off-key strings! The video quality is pretty horrible, as well--worse than standard cable. A real travesty
0	'Science' Fiction it's not.... The basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine' integrate back into society.  Yes, it's been done before but still holds promise.  The plot was adequate.The acting was believable - no complaints there.  I particularly enjoyed Sean Pertwee as 'Mace'.  And Jason Isaacs has long been a favorite actor.But what ruined the movie for me was the science.  I'm not a fanatic - I have no problems with FTL travel or spaceships 'banking' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies.  And I realize that movies are not 'real'.  But I've never seen more 'bad' science in any one movie.  My son and I watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers.I could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night.  It spoiled the whole movie for me
0	Mediocre Mystery Movie !. Even though I own most of the "Poirot Offerings" starring David Suchet owing to my affinity for Agatha Christie's work,I still maintain that "Peter Ustinov" is by far more at home in "Poirot's" shoes as evident by his inimitable performences as the belgian eccentric/sleuth over the years.particularly in the "Death on the Nile"(1978).And having said that, the latest addition to A&E's Poirot caper of the same name featuring Suchet is unfortunately "Toothles and Meandering" at best.In short,If you already own the Original ( Ustinov )version,then don't even bother spending your hard-earned on this trite
0	Medicore at best. I really felt like I had to give some real insight to the people who are wondering whether they should watch this or not.You people writing the reviews are being waaay to generous to this movie.With how slow the movie started off you would think that the relationship between the two main characters would slowly and steadily build up-from a close friendship to a romantic relationship.The guys don't even display a close friendship at the beginning, how are they gonna jump from "a guy you see during soccer practice and around your building" to "hot and heavy can't live without each other love"?It's not believable, and doesn't make for a good coming of age love story that this movie tries to be.The movie just hits you with an abrupt and sudden love scene, and from there they are suddenly in love and everything.In fact,there is no indication that either character is gay until that scene.I mean it would have been nice if the movie showed that one guy was into his neighbor or checked him out from time to time, or even was interested in guys in general but as I said before the movie doesn't display any type of interest the guys may have in each other or just guys in general until the love scene.Don't get me wrong,I enjoyed the movie but the reviewers here aren't really giving an accurate representation of the movie and are HIGHLY overrating it.So if your in the mood for an ok gay teen movie by all means grab some popcorn sit back and enjoy.If you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema involving a gay relationship.Look somewhere else.This is not the movie
0	I've been cheated by Amazon. It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey.I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly.Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters
0	Great movie, lousy DVD. While this is a great movie, this DVD reproduction does it severe injustice. The sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the DVD is marginal
0	OH...THE PAIN.  THE PAIN OF IT ALL... Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually HURTS to watch it.From the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters (odd, considering that in interviews after the first movie, all of them said they'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel), to the horrible (even by 1997 standards) CG effects, to the cliched fight scenes (gee...two women in a mud pit.  I bet it took them all night to come up with that one), virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie DID go wrong with this movie.Loosely based on the story of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game (and set immediately after the first movie, which, while not great, looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stinkburger), the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting Shao Khan (played by Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from The X-Files) and his army (shown in most scenes as a small band of extras.  Oooh...scary.) as they attempt to take over Earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as Outworld.  This merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity.With only a week to do anything about it, Lord Raiden (played by James Remar, replacing the, and I can't believe I'm saying this, much better Christopher Lambert in the role) once again enlists the help of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonia Blade (Sandra Hess), and Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), along with help from a select few other characters from the video games' crowded lineup, to prevent this from happening.The story in and of itself is not necessarily bad.  However, given the film's obviously low budget the weak screenplay, the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film, and most jarringly, direction even more inept than that of Paul W.S. Anderson, it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high, only to have practically everything come crashing down.The only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack, featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie, as well as music by KMFDM, Megadeth, Rammstein, Juno Reactor, and others.If ever you're looking to punish yourself for something, then by all means watch this movie.  However, if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself, you will avoid this movie like the plague.  Believe me, you'll thank yourself later.
0	What shark??. I watched this movie, seeing that it was a "shark" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, "okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else
0	Say no to dubs. Even though fans of HK cinema have as a whole come a long way since HK films were generally only seen in the states on Saturday afternoon television, some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing HK films in their original language with subtitles.  This film is available from Columbia Tristar only in a dubbed format, and for that reason I won't be getting the Region 1 release of this film
0	Travesty. An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here
0	Not my cup of tea. I bought this DVD based on reviews here on Amazon. I won't fault others for thier position, it's just a matter of personal taste. For me this was a big disapointment. The story leaves a lot to be desired. The character Walker (Lee Marvin) gets away with a lot of crimes he shouldn't have. The direction seemed to be a practice in doing something different, but it failed. I'm sorry I bought this DVD
0	Beware of Unbox!!!. Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for
0	Does not live up to the hype. It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant .Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching "I like to play games" , its a much better soft-porn movie.
0	What's up with that?. I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show
0	This movie ruined my life. Bad Moon begins in some South American country where Michael Pare and his girlfriend are attacked by a werewolf. The movie stumbles quickly into the perspective of Thor, a wonderfully loyal german shepherd owned by Mariel Hemingway (Whom I tend to think is kind of scary looking with her weird cheekbones and her sunken eyes) and her son (the little boy who played Dennis the Menace). Michael Pare, who is Mariel's brother, soon comes into the picture, struggling to come to grips with the attack and his living a life as a werewolf. At first, you feel pity for his character...I mean, the guy witnessed his lover attacked and eaten by a monster and is now himself living the life of the beast...but, you soon feel nothing but disgust and hatred towards the man when he decides to have a mental battle with Thor. The movie was scary and tense in parts and the gore factor was high , but I had such a hard time with some scenes in the film. I was VERY disturbed by the scene where Michael Pare's character entices Thor to bite him, therefore getting Thor hauled off by Animal control people in a truly heartwrenching scene that still to this day makes me sick. The movie is good in some aspects, The directing is good and you truly fear for the people in the situations they are in. The Creature effects are excellent and I much rather prefer costume/physical makeup werewolves over the newer, Van Helsing type Werewolf that CGI designs have come up with. There is NOTHING worse than a computer animated werewolf, just watch the movie CURSED to see what I mean. This movie, to me, is all about watching a poor territorial dog who wants to protect his owners, get pushed around. The CGI in this movie was awful just because it was 1996 and CGI was pretty much new to movies at that time, so the transformation scene in the end was a crapfest. The hero of the movie, Thor, is what I am giving this movie 2 stars for, because the dog really does pull through for the viewer and make them care. You kind of watch the movie only for the dog. You want the dog to live and get through it-and almost could care less about the family by the end of the film. Overall, the movie was scary and the werewolf was pretty good compared to some of the crap that has been out there in the past, but the dog getting knocked around and tortured throughout the movie was enough to ruin my life forever. At least the ending was somewhat happy....I was somewhat confused by the dream she had-but it seems to end with everything alright. Oh well, the movie was decent but could have been longer and could have had less traumatic incidents involving the dog
0	Cant watch. I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok
0	Ponderous. Welcome to Bucharest where Zachary (David Gunn) the vampire killer has come to hunt the creatures that turned the woman he loved into a monster he had no choice but kill.  This time his objective is Ash (Jonathan Morris), a master vampire who maintains his tribe in the secret Bucharest underground while operating a very high toned nightclub as a lure for new 'blood.'What Zachary doesn't count on is his attraction for Sofia (Kirsten Cerre), a beautiful American pianist who has come to Bucharest to perform and who has become the object of Ash's desires.  Not only must Ash deal with Zachary's attempts to destroy his nest and reclaim Sofia, he has political problems among his own vampire servants.Welcome to a film where everyone speaks as if they used to have a Romanian accents and only saw the scripts a week ago.  The is a kind of heavy handed lack of emotionality about this film as vampires announce their intent to destroy each other with almost no inflection in their voices.While this is a pretty film to watch, with lots of midnight scenes of Bucharest, the moodiness of the cinematography and the score are not matched by the acting.  Obligatory scenes with fake blood and frontal nudity give the work a sense of awkwardness that Director Ted Nicolaou never quite manages to overcome
0	Wasting space on my DVD shelf... I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it.
0	STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE. Director Steve Kloves manages to make Texas look both gorgeous and desolate.  Thomas Newman's score is haunting and evocative; Dennis Quaid, James Caan, Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow offer complex, fleshed out performances.  What destroys the film in my opinion is its listless pandering, its inability to focus on the truth of the issues and its ambiguous and unfulfilled ending.  FLESH AND BONE also pulls a big coincidence that manages to be both improbable and unbelievable.  Kloves "twist" is predictable from the moment Meg Ryan appears on the screen, and the inevitable confrontation between Quaid and Caan is also telegraphed a mile away.  In spite of its good performances and atmospheric direction, FLESH AND BONES is empty and pointless
0	Special Effects are Just Cheezy. I can see that whoever made this, put a lot of time and money into it trying to make this a big successful production, however, this fantasy film is best for ages 10 and under. Special effects, script lines, acting and story are significantly lacking what the blockbuster's have. Too bad.
0	Stealing Beauty. The movie could have been so much more with less caracter's. Liv Tyler is very good. Rachel Weisz is only in the movie for short stints but, memberable ones. The soundtract is better than the film.
0	&quot;Is theah a convick in that theah closet?&quot;. Strange stuff--Duvall rants, gibbers, and fires a shotgun into an empty closet. Haas watches, listens, and smiles a lot. The great James Earl Jones wanders in, scratches his beard and mutters to himself, and walks out again. If this sounds like your kind of thing, jump right in. But nobody's ever going to claim this is Horton Foote's finest hour

0	An Abomination!!. I am a big fan of this franchise however, I refuse to include this in the series! They should've put the title "National Lampoon's" before this.. it's the worse horror sequel I have ever seen and coming from me.. that is pretty bad because, I have seen them all. Leatherface has never been played so horribly! During the majority of the movie he looked like a phat bull dyke! Renee Zellweger hadn't finished her acting classes obviously.. she was terrible and, I wanted her to be hung up on a hook!! I heard she went cross country stopping at every video store she passed in an effort to buy and burn every rental copy she could get her hands on! The sad fact is, this will always be around to haunt both her and Matthew McConaughey.
0	AMAZON SUCKS. I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!
0	THE THIEF OF BAGDAD. This was awful. I'm sorry I spent a penny on this.
0	Good God. This movie is Bloodsport minus the entertaining parts. Better production value- much worse script. Much worse everything almost. So if you liked Bloodsport which even at its cheesiest was a classic entertaining martial arts flick and you wanted to see another version of it that sucks but has more scenery, well here you go!

0	Extremely Annoying. If you like action flicks with absolutely no intelligence this movie will appeal to your deepest of hearts, but for those of you who prefer a plot and something that makes at least a little sense....skip it.A sports camera crew sets out to find the most daring of extreme sports heroes so that it can film an action movie in the Alps. They recruit a couple of crazy snow-boarders, helicopter pilots willing to outrun avalanches and then they toss in a pretty and dainty Olympic skier for good measure and some eye candy. The entire film consists of the frilly skier competing with the fearless snow boarders for attention and film time. They get thrown out of helicopters at high altitude without any oxygen and wearing barely any clothes but they never freeze...funny how that happens in movies! The real amazing feat is how they ski downhill in front of a major avalanche and can still talk to one another...have you ever heard how loud an avalanche is? Thank goodness for those sub-atomic hearing aids!! Eventually European terrorists enter the picture and a few automatic weapons (something has to encourage those slow moving avalanches). Well you know how it goes.The action is great and if you like skiing some of the stunts are literally unbelievable but other than that I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone with half a brain because you will just be frustrated with all of the impossibilities and missed reasons for people to die. I only watched it because I was forced into it by a couch potato with a remote.
0	Disgusting and pointless. "Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa?""I am a little busy, JP (Quiet, babe! Can't you see? I am talking to my producer here!). Just get another broad for the role: anybody, only with a good front.""But, Maestro! We'd have to re-shoot half of the movie. Fernando is already talking of another engagement. In any event, with his rate if we use him again, it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick. We might as well scrap the whole thing.""Don't worry, JP. We'll keep shooting as if nothing happened. That's what being Great Director all about. They are morons, or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage. Most won't even notice that the face is different, and those who do, will find a good explanation for it. Subliminal, surreal, existential, women are alike - all that nonsense, you know. Relax and have a drink."
0	Disappointed. I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie.  My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it.  My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting.  It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well.  The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward.  Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there.  Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast.  We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California).  I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself "why?  Why am I wasting my time like this?
0	UNWATCHABLE !. Save your money.  I gave up halfway through and shredded the DVD.  Amanda Peet was great in "Saving Silverman", but she should be mortified by this movie.  "Whipped" was probably written by two fifteen-year-olds on their junior high lunch break.  Absolutely abysmal
0	Is ''cringe-worthy'' a word?. I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch
0	Poor support. This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet
0	Why the Charge. Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	This is Horrible. I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that..
0	Water-logged. Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- "Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again," attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.
0	Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors. I purchsed this video a few years ago and was also very disappointed. I have nothing more to add to the other reviews posted here; just to agree that the sound was poor and the viewing quite fuzzy. I remember watching not only the first broadcast on NBC but several broadcasts years after that, with different casts. It was and still is my favorite Christmas story. I will certainly purchase the Schippers CD and hope to see another video or DVD in the future
0	Boring to watch. The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to buy it.
0	Nothing like the book. Although this movie is based loosely on the book, the hour and a half it runs for gives no time to explore all of the nuances of the book's extraordinary adventure.  I loved the book, which was well written and thought out, but the movie has basically butchered Christopher Paolini's great fantasy novel.To do a movie like this, the time frame needs to be similar to Lord of the Rings.  Another hour or so, and this could have been a good movie.  The only reason I gave this two stars is for the dragon and Jeremy Irons.Rent if you still want to see it, don't buy
0	UnBox video not yet working. Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200
0	I won't buy it... Someone just today told me I should see this film.What a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality DVDs being produced by Fox Lorber.Oh well
0	Why the Charge. Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	Irritating and unorigional. I don't remember seeing Isild Le Besco in any other films, but she does look a bit familiar.  If I have seen her elsewhere, it must have been in a role that she performed with much greater insight and finesse than Gwen from 'Girl's Can't Swim', or I definitely would remember.  I'm still not sure what the title actually means... something about young women struggling to find their way... blah blah blah... but, it actually wasn't a terrible film.  Nevertheless, Le Besco's performance is one of the most irritating I've seen in years.  I was reminded of Dorothy Parker's cutting remark when critiquing a Katherine Hepburn film: 'She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.'Le Besco was either shown with an extremely obnoxous smile plastered on her face, or she was smacking her friends or family in a 'hissy fit of rage'.  These tantrums always ended with Gwen running off to the sea with all the grace of a three-legged moose.  What made LeBesco's performance stand out even more was the fact that everyone else's performances were nearly flawless.This film was recommended to me after purchasing 'L'Effrontee', a truly marvelous picture.  While watching the first 30 minutes of 'Girl's Can't Swim' I could see that I was not the only person who admired 'L'Effontee's' subtle brilliance.  Obviously the director and/or screenwriter of 'Girl's Cant' Swim' intended on building upon the other film's message, but as a lark, they subtracted all of its poignance and sensitivity.I give the film 2 out of 5 because, despite its flaws, it is still superior to the vast majority of 'toejam' that hollywood produces each year
0	BORING, TACKY. Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled. Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet, hence the title. I've seen far worse, but those worse movies were more &quot;enjoyable&quot; than this. The following morning you probably won't remember having seen it. If only the monster had eaten this movie's negative, then we would all be spared
0	Warning Incomplete Episode!!!. The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them
0	KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!. KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!   THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL, ALL, ALL, TIME SINCE THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE AND BEFORE THAT! IN THEATERS I WAS THE ONLY ONE WATCHING THAT MOVIE AND I FELT LIKE WALKING OUT!! I WANTED TO CRY  :( THE ACTORS STINK ALONG WITH THE PLOT AND 3-D EFFECTS!!!All I can say is BOOOOOOOOOO THIS MOVIE SUCKS
0	Dreary, hard to watch. Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.
0	Star Trek:  City on the Edge of Forever. My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD
0	Brings back memories but ultimately it disappoints..... Yep, like many viewers I watched this when I was too young and was scared for like weeks on end and couldnt get the tall man image out of my head. Well, when this got re-released I just "had" to have it figuring it would bring back memories and really allow me to get into once again. Unfortunately because I am now older and hopefully a little wiser, the film ends up being a rather cheesey horror movie with a mix-mash plot and NO tension or scary moments whatsoever.Hey, I wasnt looking for a Dustin Hoffman like performance in a horror movie but geeez the acting was pretty rough and forced. The plot started off pretty cool but then began to not know what to do with itself and got almost silly towards the end. The mausoleum itself was eerie but the dwarf guys (Star Wars Jawas?) were pretty funny and the whole thing just didnt add up. As always in horror films a quick call to the police is all it would have taken to stop this Tall man, but no.... lets grab the trusty shotgun and take care of it ourselves...... c'mon.The scene with the plastic bug in the jacket made me laugh outloud and I rewound it just to get another laugh. The film makers had to know how silly this looked.... didnt they?  I hope that scene was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek or the film makers need to rethink their film careers. And of course, the thought process of the characters just didnt make any logical sense. I wont go into details, you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.  Oh yeah, the mustard-covered fingers was also a classic laugh moment.The silver fyling ball is still cool as hell and that alone earned the movie an extra star rating from me. I do like Jody, he tries to do the right things for the most part and has that waaaay cool 'Cuda that he drives around.  Little Mike was just a young kid and you almost felt bad for him losing so many people he cared for.... it had to be tough.  However, that doesnt excuse the inherent silliness of the movie or the plot that just doesnt unfold correctly or logically.  Maybe I expected too much, maybe I've become an overly-critical movie watcher, but nontheless, I cant recommend this other than for a quick watch.  Rent it, dont buy it since it has really zero redeeming qualities or multiple-viewing value.This could have been soooooo much better with a the proper direction and a little more time put into the films flow. It was  a great concept for horror. Sci-Fi thrown in with mystical elements as well. Great starting point and it was refershingly different as opposed to the usual "10 kids go camping and get hacked by an ax murderer" [...] that you always see. Again though....it was NOT polished at all and just didnt work well enough.Sorry If I've burst the proverbial bubble of the movies fans. But, its a "cult" classic for a reason. Much like the Rocky-Horror Picture Show, the event is the real attraction for the fans...the movie itself is horrible and pointless but fans dont want to face that fact so they hide behind the "cult classic" label.  Hey, whatever.... :)By the way: The DVD quality is only average.  I expected a better transfer but on my plasma based Home theater, it was pretty grainy and not up to par with  what a re-release should be, IMO.[...
0	AMAZON SUCKS. I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!!
0	What's up with that?. I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show
0	If you're looking for a fairy tale, this is the movie for you. Aside from some of the special effects, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.The story is basically an updated version of Pinnochio and it left me feeling cheated. I kept watching it becaue I expected so much more but it never, and I do mean never, delivered. I believe that I was supposed to feel pained over what the human race suffers but I just felt sad that I spent so much time with this movie
0	I've been cheated by Amazon. It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey.I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly.Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters
0	Worst acting ever!. I turned this movie on one morning and was glued to it for 30 mins because I just knew it was a joke! WHM spoke as if he were on an infomercial, and the actress who played the student was no better.Knowing now that it was based on a play makes perfect sence. Plays hardly ever translate to good films! The acting in a play is just totally different, overly dramatic, not believable.Sorry, I hate to write a review based on 30 mins in the middle of a movie, but I purposely researched the title of this one so I could warn others off. No, actually, DO watch it! I want you to see for yourself how awful it is!and I like W.H. Macy
0	Dont get "Fiji" final week ... Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show
0	Warning, Waste of Money. I'm trying to figure out what movie these other reviewers were watching. I wasted my money so you won't waste yours. It was so boring, I skipped through most of it and deleted it 1/2 way through
0	kultur shock. This is a total DVD disaster fom Kultur. I have tried two copies of this wonderful performance and both had a miserable soundtrack and opera is sound. Volume swells and fades throughout the performance destroying a terrific production. Would love to know what Placido Domingo thinks of it. Dr. Mirakle must have been the sound mixer
0	Really, really bad movie... one of the worst movies i've seen. Man, there's no way to describe this movie.Slow, boring, unidimensional, bad plot, really bad acting...Really low-budget (in a bad way)I'm not gonna get my time or my money back. I bought it based on the reviews, and they were really off... Even if you enjoy the gothic ambience, believe me, it's really bad.You've been warned
0	1.75 STARS: It's hard to give this movie any credit. After watching "Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper", I came away with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, "Anthropohagus" had its moments (albeit quite few) where it was somewhat chilling.  The Anthropohagus, himself, was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain.  Some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror, but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between.  Unfortunately, the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie, and for some reason, it is just very difficult to get over this fact in "Anthropophagus" probably because these weaknesses are so glaring."Anthropophagus" may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes, so the gore-hound shouldn't be disappointed with this flick.  However, with that being said, "Anthropophagus" simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience, and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love.  Ultimately, what you have in "Anthropophagus" is horrible acting, a poorly written screenplay, uneven and poorly developed plot and action, below average plot execution, just a couple of scary moments, some laughable scenes, a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting, deplorable and depraved scene of violence (fetus scene) that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that I've ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror.  If that kind of thing appeals to you, this could be right up your alley, but it doesn't do much for me.  I would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension, suspense and a scary story, and you simply do not get that in "Anthropophagus".  To answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie...did "Anthropophagus" bother me? No.  Did I think it was scary?  Certainly not, laughable at some points in the movie but not scary, and nor did I find it disturbing.  However, it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low-budget Italian-made horror flick? Touche!In my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack, what did I find in "Anthropophagus" but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline.  Indeed, it is very difficult to give this movie any credit.  A word of advice, if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings (like I did with this one), it probably just sucks.  For all intents and purposes, that is the case with "Anthropophagus-The Grim Reaper".  Nevertheless, sadly, I've seen much, much worse.
0	Cruel Brittania. Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly"
0	Wayne and Hepburn Take "African Queen" Route. The unique screen chemistry between John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn barely elevates a Western rehash of "The African Queen." Without Wayne and Hepburn, this belated sequel to "True Grit" wouldn't pass muster as a made-for-TV movie. It's too bad Peter Bogdanovich didn't take up the Duke's offer to direct the project -- he might have improved upon Martha Hyer's routine script. This was Wayne's next-to-last Western, but he would end his career in a blaze of glory with "The Shootist" (1976)
0	Far and Away. Very disappointed because I can't watch it on my DVD player. I would have asked for a refund and returned it but don't know how to go about doing that on Amazon
0	Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space seem like Shakespeare. What a great cast!  I mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie, right?  After it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it, although you are shaking your head in disbelief!  Stunning!  You've never seen anything quite like it!  If you are a fan of the campy awful, you may see it as a masterpiece, if not you will still have a unique viewing experience.Proceed at your own risk!  Borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it.Did I mention the great cast?  So many of my favorites...even Goodman can't save this clunker
0	Great Movie - HORRIBLE DVD. The move is one of my favorite sci-fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to DVD that I have seen. There are no special features and NO CHAPTER STOPS, this is as if they copied a video tape to a DVD. I could accecpt it being full frame but if I had known that it was this cheap a transfer I would not have purchased it
0	Rent it, don't buy it, and then fast forward. I consider myself fairly open when it comes to unique, or even delayed plot structure, except here. I must admit, the best parts of this movie were in the trailer. This movie made no sense, and the only possible reference to Babel was that you could understand no one. I fast forwarded through 1/2 of the 2.5 hour movie, and didn't miss a thing. If you must watch it, rent it and don't think it's worth keeping for an extra day based on the trailer, it won't be
0	Silly claptrap. Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit.
0	Like, Almost Totally Gross!. Although Valley Girl came out when I was a teenager, it somehow eluded me until now. I bought it because of the favorable reviews, and of course, for the sheer nostalgia. I won't say it's a BAD movie, but I would compare it directly to The Last American Virgin in terms of screenplay, story and acting. Unlike The Last American Virgin, however, this film has an awful sountrack, and it didn't really end in a notable way.From a filmmaking standpoint, this seems amateurish. Apparently this is where director Martha Coolidge cut her teeth, because she went on to direct the remarkably good college film, Real Genius, just two years later.The big problem with this film is shallowness. We never learn much about any of the characters, so it's not easy to care about them. I still can't figure out why the lead characters were attracted to each other, since the only way they ever describe each other is "hot". They never engage in deep conversations or share secrets with each other. There's no depth to the relationship at all.Another problem is that all the high school students in this film appear to be about 18-22 years old, while the sexy mother of one teenage girl appears to be under 30 years old herself. A whole subplot that revolves around the mother (Beth, played by Lee Purcell) is unsatisfactorily resolved about half-way throught the film, then never mentioned again. Even so, I like her temptations a lot more than Stifler's Mom in American Pie!Lisa Foreman's lead character, Julie, behaves less like a "Valley Girl" of the 1980's than she does an ordinary middle class teenager living in Overland Park, Kansas. If you're familiar with Moon Unit Zappa's song, "Valley Girl", you'll find almost none of that kind of language in this film. Nicolaus Cage's character, Randy, is likeable enough, but he looks more like a member of Jefferson Starship than a "punk" (his almost mullet-like hair is blown upward on top--that's it!). Unfortunately, for an "odd couple" story like this to work, you need to emphasize the extreme difference between the characters. But these characters could have easily been neighbors from childhood. They don't seem at all from the other side of the tracks.The obligatory montage scene fails because it continues for the entire length of the song, "I'll Melt With You". A montage is meant to compress time, and dragging it out for an entire song defeats that purpose. They should have faded it out after 45-60 seconds for more effect.The most entertaining characters in the film, by far, are Julie's parents--a couple of former hippies who were obviously the prototype for Berke Lander's parents in the hilarious 2001 teen film, "Get Over It".The soundtrack, too, is terribly inferior to The Last American Virgin, and doesn't represent the early 1980's well at all. Only the aforementioned "I'll Melt With You" stands out as a great song. Meanwhile, a tune that repeats the question "Johnny Are You Queer?" seems oddly out of place at a preppy high school prom.From a nostalgia standpoint, I didn't feel like I was watching an 80's movie at all. In fact, the most pleasant nostalgia in the film was seeing ashtrays on every table (even though the characters didn't smoke), which reminded me for the first time in years that California was once part of a free country, and wasn't always ruled by neurotics. Frankly, I was surprised that the Orwellian thought-police hadn't airbrushed all those ashtrays out of the film. Today, every surface in California is littered with a fear-mongering Proposition 65 warning stickers instead. I'm so grateful I was a teenager in the 1980's, rather than today!Overall, this film fails on too many counts to recommend it, but I wouldn't blame you for checking it out. It's good enough fun for 99 minutes. The Special Edition DVD adds quite a few features that make the DVD worthwhile, if you can get it cheap!
0	Assistant Night Manager of Illusions, maybe. It's always nice to watch Famke Janssen, of course, but I like it better when she's either a very smart X-Person or a Bond-busting sadist.  This movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh.  And the bad guy was like an evil version of Sgt. Carter from Gomer Pyle - totally implausible.  I think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them
0	Pipi Longstocking. Pipi LongstockingPippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named Pipi. She has a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nelson. Next door are two very polite children named Tommy and Annika and they become friends. I like that I can relate to Annika in that she is always hesitant but after she gets started she doesn't want to stop Pipi's fother is a sea man and left her at the house with a	suitcase full of gold pieces. Pipi likes to go on adventures. One was when Pipi tricked two thieves into leaving her house with nothing This is just one example of the many heroic adventures in this exciting book. I like that it has a moral that is deep so you have fun reading it and you close the book with a smile
0	A BIG BOMB AND A STINKER FOR TOM CRUISE!. This movie is nearly 3 hours of hot air as bad as the movie The Hindenburg! If George C Scott saw this movie he would be rolling over in his grave! I yawned so much that I got a charley horse in my neck and nearly had a stroke from being bored to tears! Saddam Hussein should be strapped in a chair and be forced to watch this movie- maybe then would he confess of his atrocities that he committed! Stay as Far and Away from this movie as you can!
0	more like 2 and a half stars. Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise. I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie.i felt it was too long and drawn out. Too much time was spent on Lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left. she whined to her reporter friend, she whined to her husband, she whined to clark kent, she whined to her boss, and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene. essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick. and although the soundtrack was stunning at times, too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play. yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough.  basically im saying this movie was 90% melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10% action.and although the action scenes where pretty cool, it is nothing we haven't seen before in a superman flick, or any other super hero flick.acting wise, i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job, nothing compaired to reeves, but im not going to complain about that too much, he was servicable. and noone can complain about kevin spacey, he is just awesome, although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex. did not like louis lane. too whiney.story wise, this movie didnt really make much sense. it was way too out there. i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on. lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go "yeah lets move there" and lex is going to make lots of money. not likely. i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable. i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work. i mean most criminals want their power NOW, instant gratification. maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline, i just think they could have thought of something better, and more feasable.this movie was alright, it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away. and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies, cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie. however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book
0	What a let down/disappointment this film was!. Vanilla Sky is quite a disappointment considering the presence of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Penelope Cruz, among others!The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond "below average!"Tom Cruise and the rest of this AMAZING cast are given terrible lines and bad roles.  A shame, really...The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words...As for the plot, school plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better storylines!  It is truly sad...It seems as though the writers/directors/producers decided to go artsy-fartsy on us, following in the dreaded footsteps of other such "films" as It's All About Love and the Russian Ark.So it's a weak plot, and a GREAT-but-wasted cast and setting, which when put together fail to take off.  No masterpiece here.
0	Not Happy. I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?
0	A rather boring movie/adaptation despite Vincent Price's brilliance. I simply thought that "The Fall of the House of Usher" was rather boring and I found myself dozing off.  I thought that "The Pit and the Pendulum" was a much better flick and a much more interesting adaptation.  In fact, I was quite disappointed with this adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant short story "Fall of the House of Usher".  While the movie provides a grim atmosphere in accordance with the Poe's story, the movie drags and never really picks up enough steam to keep one's interest...however, I found the actual story written by Poe to be quite interesting and very entertaining...perhaps that is my problem with the movie as it is not nearly as good as the story itself.  This movie "The Fall of the House of Usher" could have been much better.  Notwithstanding the poor adaptation of Poe's classic story of despair, Vincent Price, as always, was terrific in his role...still, this is not enough to make this a good adaptation.  I recommend watching the clearly superior "The Pit and the Pendulum" instead of this flick
0	WHAT???????. This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good.  But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary.  Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers
0	NO STARS movie!. A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade. The all important role of Shiela seems little more than an after thought. Turned into a silly love story (which doesn't even play!) it is merely sad. Sad...and very, very BAD!!!(the one star rating is because I HAD to rate it!
0	Ambrose Bierce is a Better Authority. I have rented this video for the sake of a trip down Memory Lane. Of course, fourteen years produce a great shift in gullibility. I hated this video for its teaching of American ideology in perhaps the least open manner imaginable. For example, in
0	Sub-par issue of Excellent series. The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" & "Fanny & Alexander," von Trier's "The Kingdom," Fassbinder's "Berlin Alexanderplatz," Kusturica's "Underground," and Petersen's "Das Boot," The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode may pop up in another).  The stories of The Dekalog are morality plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments, but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two.  Kieslowski & Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's best up & coming director's to do each, as was initially planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories.  I won't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature.  His films often tackle issues of political import, however he intentionally avoids making "issue films," but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in Poland before, during & after the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style.This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that, you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode, very annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be. Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast, so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape.  The picture is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits. The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features, particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no option to turn of the English dub & use subtitles instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The Dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition, which is inexcusable given the price
0	Star Trek:  City on the Edge of Forever. My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD
0	Dont get "Fiji" final week ... Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show
0	NO JET LI DIDN'T!. I love Jet Li, I collect all his dvds but this movie really [stank]! Don't buy it even for the collection! Nobody will notice that you don't have it
0	Spend a couple hours of your life with 7 vile people. Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama.
0	I will never watch this again.... As a lover of many types of music, this movie sparked my interest....so I rented it.  I found myself thinking throughout the movie "I can't believe I'm actually watching this.  What a waste!"  Not only was the plot slow to the point of boring, but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that I (as a grown woman) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes.  The small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story.  Also, please carefully consider before allowing children to watch!! I will NEVER, under any circumstances watch this movie again. (I want the reader to know that I am in no way a movie critic.  I am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what I found to be a complete waste of an evening.
0	Beware of Unbox!!!. Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for
0	Why the Charge. Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs
0	read the book instead. This movie,   the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it,  is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime.   The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious.    Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures.    Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint,   read the book instead.
0	DVD PUT IT ON DVD. I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE
0	Cheesy Sci-Fi flick only has *some* good things to offer, but its really silly... Josh Charles (S.W.A.T., Tv's Sports Night) finds out that he is the bearer of a key that can make you travel into different dimensions. Andrea Roth brings him to her friend, played by Rutger Hauer (The Hitcher, Sin City) who guides Charles and tells him that his father was a timedimensional warrior and that he could be too as well. On the evil end, baddie Stuart Wilson (No Escape, The Mask of Zorro) wants the key and the septer that goes along with it so he can fuse worlds together and be the ruler and what not and the trio must bring back the septer to the right place before evil hands get on it and the fate of the world is at risk. Interesting idea is squandered by sillyness and dumb dialouge and some pretty crummy acting, altough Charles saves this from being a total disaster. It's good to see Hauer not being a bad guy but he's wasted along with Wilson. AND, well, it was surprising to see Jack Black (School of Rock, King Kong) in this movie...one before he became famous. Black does his mannerisms and speech. Watch it once and then dimension jump the hell out of the room.
0	Tangled gets tangled in its own self......a big bore. Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake).
0	0 STARS:  This movie sucks. "Sometimes They Come Back" is a terrible attempt at a horror movie.  I love Tim Matheson and I think he is a very good actor, but this movie is just incredibly lame.  The idea that these four little punks with leather jackets on are supposed to be scary as ghosts simply does nothing for me except make me thoroughly disappointed that I wasted my time watching this crap.  The is movie is a JOKE!!The scene this movie is based on is a sad scene for sure, but to base the whole movie on it is going to far with nothing.  Basically, this whole movie is much ado about nothing.I think the biggest joke and the most terrible thing about this movie are these little leather jacket wearing punks as ghosts are supposed to scare the viewer and it simply does not work!!  The premise behind this movie is flawed and lacking in substance from which a horror movie can be successfully derived."sometimes They Come Back" is entirely ineffective as a horror movie and evokes only laughter from a sophisticated horror movie fan.  The sequel is so bad, it is not worthy of a comment.  Some people call "Sometimes They Come Back" a good horror movie...I just call it rubbish
0	Survivor Rip Off. I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show
0	I can't believe people enjoy this movie. This movie is complete garbage. I actually like Robert Downey Jr as an actor but hated him in this movie. Please do yourself a favor and don't watch this trash
0	Just another boring '70s movie. First off, the name of the movie and the cover art are completely misleading - this has nothing to do with any sort of "Graveyard", and if they wanted to give you an idea of what you'll see inside, they would have put a grainy, washed out picture of a typical '70s housewife on the cover.  This is a really boring '70s detective drama about a rash of deaths in a small town.  Some FBI guy is called in to investigate.  As it turns out, there are some women who, via some genetic cross-breeding that gets only the vaguest of explanations, are now running around having sex with men until they die.  The FBI guy figures this out by making a gigantic leap in logic.  At the very end there are some sci-fi elements, but that's about it.  Oh yeah, there's also a lot of topless women in it - just about every female in the movie gets topless.  That's about the only good thing this movie has going for it.The picture quality is horrible, it looks like it was made from an old worn out video tape.  It also looks like whoever filmed it didn't know how to use a camera, as many of the outdoor scenes are completely washed out (the naked girl on the motorcycle looks like a white blob), and many of the indoor scenes are extremely dark.  The sound, advertised as Dolby 2.0, is simply mono.Overall, don't waste your time.  It's not "fun" or "cheesy", it's just a crummy '70s flick that is rather boring, and the DVD transfer is terrible.

1	J.M. for W.M. I love anything Ravi Zacharias writes.  He brings you to the only conclusion possible in whatever spiritual truth he is presenting, and I love this.  But greater still --- there is in Ravi Zacharias a truth that transcends intellect -- he genuinely loves the Lord he writes (or speaks) about.  This makes his books or his sermons worth my attention
1	Get &quot;Gun&quot;. I have watched the video of &quot;My New Gun&quot; three times, and each time I have discovered more interesting, telling details.  The plot doesn't drive the film; instead, it seems to evolve almost by happenstance from the characters themselves.  Although there is no &quot;crack-me-up&quot; humor at all, if you think about what is going on as it happens, this movie is hilarious.  Diane Lane, James LeGros, and Stephen Collins all shine
1	Doctor Who and the first Download. Doctor who materialised without his Tardis on this, my first timelord download in the amazon unbox, which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside.For a very reasonable sum, $1.99, my family and I were able to enjoy the first Third doctor adventure after his regeneration, where he encounters the Nestene Conciousness.The down load took only a few minutes although I had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program. thanks to the good people at amazon tech support I was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental.a great experience and will not be the last. easy to navigate and fun for all the family. someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis'
1	The Mission. I saw this video years ago but I still remember it as being very exciting and action filled with superb acting.  I think it is one of the best action-adventure film ever made.  And it was shot on location.  The photography was stunning.
1	hypnotic. in retalliation the the review thing at the top, since when was the Yam supposed to be a dance craze? when were any of their dances supposed to be a dance craze? No one else could danc elike that! anyway, I love this movie because it so funny. Ginger has incredibly funny running-amuck scenes with perfect timing. Her facial expressions arer superior. You also realize what a superb actress she was. This movie isn't the typical Fred/Ginger formula, but who minds a little change if it turns out as well as this
1	Uncredited Asian actor. The name of the uncredited Asian actor who plays the fake Mr. Moto is Teru Shimada
1	Diet for a new America. Great book, actually the second time i've bought it and read it.A great eye opener
1	Woody's Best (except maybe the earlier, funny ones). I have watched this movie probably 50-60 times, and each time I watch it I love it more.  I think this is Woody at his best, with a great cast and an amazing performance by Nick "Apollo" Forte.  Except for his "earlier, funny" films, which are in a class by themselves, this film has the perfect balance of comedy, drama, dry wit, "suspense", larger-than-life characters....reminds me of "Raging Bull"...but that's a whole 'nuther genre.  As much as I LOVE "Annie Hall", sometimes it seems dated and hard to watch....but "BDR" is timeless.  Do like I did, if you can't decide whether to put down the cash right off the bat...rent it, watch it, and buy it.  I know you will.  Bravo, Woody!  Now, what happened to the rest of your films...??
1	superb film. 'A Bronx Tale' is about a boy named Calegero Anello living in the Bronx who is torn between two worlds, the world of his father (played by Robert De Niro) and the world of a local gang leader named Sonny (played by Chazz Palminteri). The viewer gets to follow Calegero or "C" from the time that he is 9 years old to the time that he is 17 years old. In the process, Calegero/C as well as the viewer learn some valuable lessons about life
1	"Uptown Girls" is a very enjoyable movie. "Uptown Girls" focuses on the friendship that develops between Ray (an 8 year-old going on 30) and Molly, her nanny, who acts her shoe size rather than her age.  For those who have not seen this movie, it may appear corny or designed for a younger audience; however, it is much more of an adult film than it may outwardly appear.  In her usual fashion, Dakota Fanning gives an outstanding performance, with an aptitude for acting well beyond her years.  Ray and Molly's disparate personalities result in many clashes, but eventually they teach each other how to act their age - a very important life lesson
1	Grace, Poise and Class all the way. Audre Hepburns debut.  This ismy favorite movie of all time.  A romantic comedy whose characters have the highest integrity of any film I've ever viewed.  If you're not moved by this story and it's portrayal by command performances, then you're not breathing
1	Electric&amp;Grand. This Video Blows The Mind.this is a GOlden Time in Soul Music.So Many Great Talents.This is What Soul Music Used To Be About Great Talent&amp;Full Of Fantastic Performances
1	better than Dreamgirls. I took my daughter to see Dreamgirls and she loved it. I had to bust her bubble!!! And tell her the history about Sparkle Oldschool)  now she agrees with me sparkle is the best soundtrack outstanding. (Areatha Franklin)  Given him something he can feel............
1	A Very Sweet British Film. I loved this movie right from the start. Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn are wonderful together, and some of the scenes of little old ladies geting (unknowingly) giggly on "tea" are just a hoot.  I'd always liked Craig Ferguson as Mr Wick on the "The Drew Carey Show", and it's nice to see that there is so much more to him than just that character.
1	Indiscreet. What Director Stanley Donen uses excellently here are two gorgeous, sophisticated stars that fit like a glove. He also creates a deliciously elegant atmosphere with colorful, chic sets and stunning Dior gowns that comprise a feast for the eyes. "Indiscreet "will transport you to another lost, pleasant, and civilized time and place
1	Gets Better With Time. The first time I saw this film was when it came out in 1986, and at the time I was terribly disappointed.  Didn't like the film at all, thought it was amateurish and pretentious.  But then I watched it recently on DVD, and realized that it was a really good film - performances were all really good, I liked seeing the DC scenery, and the directing by Mike Nichols was wonderfully subtle.Despite the fact that both Nicholson and Streep can sometimes be overpowering, and that Nicholson did get a bit hammy at times in this (I still can't abide the scene where he sings), I found both of their performances to be deep and nuanced.  The co-stars were good too, added a lot, and I especially enjoy Catherine O'Hara's portrayal of a gossip.  Carly Simon's singing really does set the tone well for this movie, which is definitely worth watching.  And if you don't like it the first time, watch it again in a year or two, and I'll bet you'll re-appraise it more positively
1	Send In The Clowns!. Plot: Three brothers -- Casey (Nathan Forrest Winters), Geoffrey (Brian McHugh), and Randy (Sam Rockwell) -- are left on their own when their parents leave town for the weekend. They decide to visit the local carnival/circus, even though Casey is terrified of clowns. And boy is this a bad night to choose! Three anonymous mental patients (Michael Jerome West, who is credited as "Tree", Bryan Weible, and David Reinecker) have escaped and run away...to the circus! After the show is over, the real clowns -- known as Cheezo (Timothy Enos), Bippo (Frank Damiani), and Dippo (Karl Heinz Deuber) -- are slaughtered by the inmates, who steal their clothes and makeup for a creepy disguise (then again, they do seem quite delightfully mad, so maybe they actually think they ARE clowns). They eventually find their way to the house of the three brothers. And, once they realize the residents are home, they decide to have a little fun. Of course, to the brothers, this will be nothing less than a night of terror! The inmates, for reasons unknown, seem to love a good kill, and tonight they're gonna give these boys a whole house full of horrific surprises!Clowns have always been an interest of mine, and lately I've become even more interested. So, as a horror buff, I figured Clownhouse had to be the perfect flick for my evilly kooky taste. Well, while there are a few parts of the film that are certainly less than genius, I was quite impressed. Most B-movies have to take themselves lightly, or they will be a wreck. But there are a few of them that try to be full-on horror and suspense and accomplish their goal. Clownhouse wasn't particularly scary to me, but I thought -- for it's lack of comedic approach -- that it was executed very well. The acting isn't all that great, but it's not too distracting either. Once the psycho clowns start doing their business, you forget all about any underlying flaws. I think the atmosphere was what this was all about. Not to mention the fact that it was mostly believable. Almost every scene took a fairly realistic approach to the story. This sometimes causes a little boredom here and there, but for the most part makes the movie much more entertaining. The score (often an eerie big-top-ish tune, calliope style or with a music box) was definitely a pleasant surprise -- especially the theme, which can be heard in its entirety at the end credits. And, whether you're rooting for the clowns or the brothers, there are plenty of good scenes and a few creepy moments to satisfy the viewer. The concept alone is a good enough reason to see this, but I think Salva pushed it to the limit and came out with an enjoyable film for any horror fan to own. Overall, I don't really think I have any complaints. For a blockbuster hit, this would've been a bit of a disappointment. But for a rarely known B flick, I've got to give it two thumbs way up. There aren't any special features besides the theatrical trailer, but who needs 'em
1	Objection, Your Honor. This is the first novel of John Grisham and like the movie, it's very strong in characters and dialogue. At the time he wrote it, there was some pretty good attempts at making good 'lawyer' movies. "Witness for the Prosecution" comes to mind. And we had uncovered a whole raft of great new mystery writers like Parker, Crais, Lehane, George, and Grafton. But the legal-mystery novel was uncharted land and Grisham plowed it over with a passion. How was Grisham to know that like the fall of communism had given "evil empire" writers like Len Deighton and John LeCarre fits, eventually the public would tire at lawyers, even laughing at them?Nevertheless, it's a good book and also an excellent movie. If there are drawbacks, then truthfully there are some areas that require a little trust. The lawfirm itself for example. Sexual misconduct in a lawfirm? Sure. Misconduct in billing? Always. Stealing from the evidence locker of ill gotten gains? Occasionally. But murdering associates who try to leave? I don't think so. (But it does give Department of Justice cop Ed Harris a great line in the movie, "McDeere, no one has left your firm alive!")The movie has a solid script and a great cast to carry it. The lovely Jeanne Tripplehorn, the this time not very grandfatherly Wilfred Brimley, Holly Hunter, always a hoot, Gary Busey, Hal Holbrook and Law and Order's Steven Hill, to mention a few. And Tom Cruise as always doing a powerful job who suddenly realizes that the pot of gold at the end of his and Abbey's rainbow has a HAZMAT sticker on it that he's overlooked. Cruise is just great. A true Hitchkockian character, the average man with no where to run.What would you do if you found that the company you had waited for all your life was evil from top to bottom? That's The Firm. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur
1	If only there were more episodes. Firefly is a fantastic series.  My wife and I watched the DVD set from and found ourselves rationing the episodes towards the end, because we didn't want the series to be over.  Great cast, great plots, great music.  I really can't say enough about this series.  I have never enjoyed a season of any show more than I enjoyed Firefly, and everyone I've introduced to it has loved it as well
1	great foreign film. Most people have a hard time adjusting to foreign films because reading subtitles and trying to watch the film is difficult.  That's why I love Melville's Le Samourai, not much speaking throughout the film equals minimal subtitles.  This film doesn't require many lines of speech.  The main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect.  While trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him.  My first Melville film and I loved it.  If you like this one you should also see Le Cercle Rouge and especially Bob Le Flambeur
1	"My knees felt like jelly when the film was over". Cube is a very original and entertaining low budget horror film, and will most likely stay with you long after you watch it. What works well with Cube is that we go along the ride with the characters. They have no idea how they got there or what is going on, we learn everything with them. The acting was decent and the CGI effects were nothing special, but overall the creativity makes this more than your average horror movie. Anyway the more I watch the film the better it gets, and more ideas and meanings come to mind everytime. Its Good too see more people are viewing Cube, probably because the sequels are recently being shown on TV now. The sequels are pretty bad compared to the original but watch them yourself
1	NOTHING CIVIL IN THIS WAR. This movie shows the real life hell that was Andersonville.  A prison camp that turned into a death camp. Not enough food,water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there. The south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers. Basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them. A well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa
1	Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST!. The Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST drama I have seen ever. Korean, American, doesn't matter! This is better than anything I have ever seen on TV or in the movies. Hollywood cannot touch this one! Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that!My whole family, kids and all, watched this with me and loved it!I can see why Yi Soon Shin is Korea's hero and why other countries teach his methods
1	Awesome. A must have for anime comedy fans. Being a big fan of anime comedy (the intelligent, yet lame humor) I was eager to see El Hazard "The magnificent world". Because of the high price of the set, I had some hesitation (because of some poor reviews on Amazon).Well, I have to say that the bad reviews are wrong. This DVD series was totally awesome (although I admit it started a bit slow). I promise the more you keep watching, the better it gets. The plot is highly intelligent (involving dimensional and time travel) and the characters are very interesting (with distinctive special powers).Some say the humor in El Hazard is juvenile (but I would argue no more juvenile then southpark), and seriously what good comedy isn't juvenile?Some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant (because many episodes involve a doomsday device), to which I respond "Do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star"? no, ofcourse not.yes this DVD set lacks some extras, but I think Pioneer did a great job. The DVD menu presentation is beautiful, and the box is very elegant too. Hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on Ebay (beware of bootlegs). It's very hard to find a good authentic set. The sequel "alternative world" which I just ordered, individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart.For my fellow anime comedy fans, I also reccomend "Niea under 7" and "His and Her Circumstances".animation=5plot=4music=4characters=5comedy=4Total= 4.4 Star
1	This Has Been...a Love Story. I finally made my first purchase from Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience. For $1.99, I purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of "The Twilight Zone", and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection. I don't think it's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures, but for a 26-minute classic TV program, I think my 17" LCD monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience, and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean.Aired on September 15, 1961 as the show's third season opener, the episode is a Cold War fantasy appropriately called "Two" about the last two survivors on earth, a man and a woman, after an apocalyptic world war in 2109. Written and directed by TV veteran Montgomery Pittman, the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an American infantryman and she is an invading Russian soldier. Like two feral animals, they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war. He even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him. The reality of their solitary existence, however, gradually dawns on them, especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - "Prekrassnyi" - the Russian word for "lovely".What really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting. Two years before she twitched her nose on "Bewitched", a brunette Elizabeth Montgomery, looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun, plays the untrusting Russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability. The American is played by perennial tough-guy Charles Bronson, fresh from "The Magnificent Seven". Even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war, he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism. They make an odd couple, but it works splendidly. I also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century. Narrated by Rod Serling in his inimitably halting manner, the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript: "This has been...a love story." This is classic TV
1	Pretty good movie, but... I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and as great an actor as Morgan Freeman is, he is terribly mis-cast as Alex Cross.  Cross is described as a 40 year old Muhammad Ali look alike.  Not even close.  Of course, there is the part in the movie that they kill off a character that appears in a later novel.  Maybe it was all a dream as it was for a whole season of "Dallas".As with most books made into movies, something is missing.  I think what is missing is the screen writers reading the whole book.All that said, I did enjoy the movie.  There are enough twists and turns to keep you entertained
1	View and read the book as well. I saw the movie before I read Riefenstahls autobiography. When I watched the movie, I was sure it had been staged. Nothing could be THAT perfect just filmed during events.Then I read Riefenstahl's autobiography and was awed. She describes in detail what she experienced and endured to make this film. Nothing was staged. Her enemies tried to prevent her from making it, but she persevered. It is a superb documentary of a very anguished time in world history
1	OBSCURE THEME - BRIGHT FILM. In one of the reviews it's said the movie is severely cut. Hmm... I don't know. I didn't have a chance to watch it in cinema and just got the DVD. Seems fine to me - I mean there were plenty scenes of necrophilia so I don't know if it's cut or not. Of course if the DVD is really censored it'd be nice to see the original version but even like this the film delivers. Beforehand I thought it'd be either stupid or it'd be some kind of art-house dull stuff. I was wrong and slightly surprised. "Kissed" although is dealing with such an obscure, disturbing and hidden matter as necrophilia, is done very good. It's bright and for everybody. It's very sensual and erotic, exciting and serious at the same time. It's about true love although this love may seem strange to average people. It's not an exploitation flick and has nothing sleasy in it. It's very romantic and enchanting. You'll definately not regret watching it for I bet you haven't seen anything like that before. Obviously deserves to be seen and liked.
1	DVD would be better. I think it would be much better to have DVD version of this remarkable drama
1	Reveals the complexity of wants and needs. Not a typical no brainer movie.  This movie presents complex people with complex motives.  Topher Grace is effective as the successful executive who can impress top ranking executives, yet has an undeveloped personality in many ways.  He is still trying to find out who he is and what he wants in life.  This lack of maturity and goals costs him his wife.  He focuses on his job even though he isn't passionate about the work.  Quaid does not like his demotion, yet he tries to be fair to his new boss and doesn't try to sabatoge him. This is where the film differs from other, inferior movies.  He is unhappy about his new status but tries to make the best of it.  He even tries to help his new boss.  The love story is played with honesty since Quaid's daughter is too young to commit hereself to anyone, yet she's attracted to her dad's new boss.  Don't expect cheap laughs and simple answers
1	A truly memorable movie. I've watched numerous movies about the Holocaust, and each one always seems unique. Europa Europa is one such unique movie that stays with you long after viewing it. The fact-based story follows the adventures of Jupp [played excellently by Marco Hofschneider] a young Jewish teen who loses members of his family in Nazi occupied Europe, spends some time in a Bolshevik orphanage, and finally ends up amongst the Nazis, masquerading as an Aryan...I could not believe how often Jupp comes close to revealing himself, but always, he is pulled back from disaster in the nick of time. It may seem incredible and almost unbelievable, but if you happen to read true accounts by other Holocaust survivors, you will find that the incredible and miraculous plays a significant role in saving these victims of Nazi propaganda from certain death. The lead actor deserves credit for his portrayal of Jupp, and the movie itself contains enough nail-biting moments to keep you on the edge of your seat
1	(3.5 stars)The Dark Sisters of the warewolf curse, was great, but should've worked on the ending. This movie was very interesting, but why did the sister kill the indian guy? And why did the 2 bad guys just drop their guns and run, and almost every horror, characters always trip and the killer gets them? But, a good plot, could've been better. But we don't e3ven get to see how Ginger killed the indian boy. Not scary, but good to watch. Some parts were kinda gross, like the dreams the sisters get and how the warewolves literally teared those guys apart
1	A MOVIE ABOUT AMERICAN HEROES. I have waited since the advent of DVDs for this film to be released. This standout movie essentially tells the story of dedicated, patriotic public servants and how a Bureau was created that became the most effective criminal investigative and counter-espionage organization in the world. As someone has already pointed out, this movie would never be made today and perhaps that is the great tragedy.America survived and remained free through the 20th Century because of the sacrifices of men in uniform abroad and men who guarded the safety and security of the nation at home. Jimmy Stewart portrays FBI special agent Chip Hardesty over a period spanning 30 years from 1924 to the 1950s. The film unapologetically shows J. Edgar Hoover as the man who remade the Bureau in his image as an organization devoted to justice, fidelity and bravery. Since his death in 1972, Hoover has been slandered in every way possible by people who would never have dared make such attacks while he was alive. Most of those charges have since been debunked and the makers of this picture have been vindicated many times over. You will see FBI agent Hardesty investigate the murder of American Indians, the suppression of freedom of the press by the Ku Klux Klan, the murders, kidnappings, bank robberies of the 1930's road gangsters, including Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Alvin Karpis and Machine Gun Kelly, the Nazi infiltration of Latin America during the Second World War (the wartime FBI included everything from Alaska to Argentina in its bailiwick), postwar treason by American communists working for the USSR and sabotage and mass murder in the first deliberate destruction of an airliner in U.S. history. It doesn't get much better than this.This movie includes a compelling supporting cast that no film made today would ever have. They include Vera Miles as Stewart's long suffering and sometimes selfish wife, Nick Adams as a young sociopath planning matricide for the airline insurance, Harley Baer as a lazy political appointee who flees the Bureau when Hoover assumes command, Murray Hamilton as Chip Hardesty's best friend Sam Cowley, a man dedicated to justice who never wants to "cool off," Larry Parnell as young George Cowley who fights to be as good a man and an FBI agent as his father and many others.This film is a classic that I include among the ten essential films that all Americans should see from the Hollywood era when the studios made movies that made audiences proud of their country and its values. If you are looking for a SYRIANA or a JFK, this is a film you should pass over
1	Fabulous Performances. This is one program I really don't care how historically accurate it is - Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are such a joy to watch.
1	'First Blood', crossed with 'The Fugitive'. It's not hard to see how this movie got made.. a director known for gritty streetwise thrillers (The French Connection), about a soldier who was trained to kill, but now can't turn it off due to battle scarring (First Blood, anyone?), starring Tommy lee Jones reprising his role in the Fugitive, but with a twist..Tommy Lee Jones is just the right casting for the role of the 'Tracker' - a man whose father was a soldier, but trained his son how to kill, and survive in the wilderness, be stealthy - in order that he would never have to kill. Now one of his proteges has gone rogue, and TLJ is brought out of retirement to track him down, meeting along the way the FBI agent played by Connie Nielsen.The concept is a good one, if unoriginal. The idea of the tracker is fascinating, and as the extras on the DVD show, not without basis in fact - but the execution is a mixed bag.On the plus side, the knife fighting scenes have a gritty fast moving realism to them that has rarely been seen. This is one of the movies big attractions. On the minus side, the movie feels like it has been chopped up, and pieces gone missing. Even the deleted scenes only give a hint to some of the directions the movie was going. There is a cynicism about Americas military here, similar to Friedkins last movie Rules of Engagement, but whatever message comes along with that has thinned out along the way. The roles the actors play do not leave the actors room to flesh out and inhabit their characters. Connie Nielsen does her best, which is pretty darn good, in a woefully underwritten role which seems in the end to serve little useful purpose.On the whole though this is an edge of the seat chase movie, set in breathtaking, if chilly, scenery in Oregon and British Columbia, and should not disappoint. Just dont expect to remember much about it in a month or two.3 and a half stars! I rounded up to 4 for the great fight choreagraphy.
1	A very funny, satirical, and time-capsule look at the 70s. This movie will loose some of it's original appeal and humor in the heightened atmosphere of the polically correctness of the 2000s. But this movie did break new ground in the days when we used to laugh at ourselves. On the other hand, some of the "skits" are on the stupid side and may turn off a few viewers
1	A visually astounding film that works on most levels it attempts. "The Cell" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, "a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. And there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer's evil persona. The movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. While I feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, I find it to be completely fascinating.Right from the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her "patients", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. The camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. If you don't enjoy anything else about "The Cell", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.The casting is top notch also. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is fairly convincing as an FBI agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without a doubt Vincent D'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. It's an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. It's a great performance from an underrated actor.While "The Cell" doesn't work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings
1	Wow! What a fun movie!. A fun movie all around! Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke are definately the standout stars! Eventhough it's basically a romance movie it still rocks the house! I looooove the gen X 90's feeling it has to it. It really took me back. Lalaine's desire to hustle money was a great learning lesson, too. I also think that she picked the best one in the end. But, the best thing about Reality Bites is it's great filming location. H-TOWN! Makes me sooooo proud to be from here
1	Absolutely fascinating!. I watched this DVD set when I checked it out from the library where I work as a librarian. I found it so fascinating that I bought the set, knowing that I will watch it many times. The set is so chock full of information that you can't possibly absorb it all at once. David Attenborough is an absolute master of this type of educational documentary. I highly recommend watching this set, even if you just borrow it from your local public library
1	First-Rate Mystery Thriller That Floors You With Real Shocks. A group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel, where one by one, they begin to disappear.  Sounds familiar but promising; while the promise is more than fulfilled though, the familiarity is not, as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist-filled movies around.  It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release!  Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing.  Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make "Identity" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time.  If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever.  Even if you do know the gist of it, don't hesitate to see it - it'll still deliver many times over.  Indispensable for fans of mystery, drama, horror, or thrillers
1	the secert of roan inish. excellent family movie o nudity o profanity all around viewing for all ages
1	Docu-underdogs. It's a testament to how powerful this movie is that I didn't care in the slightest about the subject matter, and yet still was very emotionally affected by the trials and errors of these two kids.  I've always viewed sports as that thing that I do to have fun, and I stopped playing once people started taking it so seriously that it became too competitive to be fun.But seeing these two boys drive themselves through troubles with funds, injuries, and scholastics in order to pursue their one dream is very inspiring.  It's yet another work that makes your typical normal middle-class life seem banal in light of the accomplishments and struggles of the underdogs.Basically, it's like watching all of those millions of "underdog sports" movies, except this one has the added tension of being real: these kids can fail at any moment, and sometimes a last-second basket gets missed.  In a way it displaces all of an entire genre of sports movies and makes it only necessary to watch this one, one that is real, has real characters, has real dialog, and has real risk.--PolarisDi
1	Mysterious symbols?. Ok, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo.Those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters.They are the traditional "Mars" and "Venus" symbols representing masculinity and femininity.I also understand the last symbol representing "infinity", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of "eternal life" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity.But what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol???Are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values?(The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity)I haven't seen the movie in years but I don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot.Please also forward your thoughts to VBoston at aol.com.
1	Worthwhile. This unusal drama takes the viewer to a place where the dead visit their past life. In this movie Michelle Pfeiffer convincingly plays a ghost that visits her husband on moonlit nights at their beach house where she accidentally was killed.  Her husband, played by Peter Gallager, is clearly still hung up over his wife as displayed when he celebrates their anniversary even though Michelle is dead.  Claire Danes plays her emotionally confused daughter that also has issues with her parent's apparent continual relationship beyond the grave. Overall it was a visually stimualting and heart warming movie, that's worthwhile to watch even if the pace is a bit slow at times
1	Superb -- Then and Now. My wife and I watched McCabe and Mrs. Miller tonight, some thirty-four years after the first time.  It's all still fresh, the mud and ugliness of a new town in turn of the century west, the inarticulate missed connections of love between the two protagonists, McCabe's isolation in the town he made and Leonard Cohen's weary soundtrack scoring it all.  Despite many moments of humor, there is still no doubt for a minute that this West is headed for a tragic ending.  And when it comes, in a fortuitous snowstorm, it is a brilliantly choreographed one-on-three quarter-hour showdown.  (Cold Mountain's climax from a couple years ago is, I now realize with this refreshed viewing of McCabe, a pale carbon copy of Altman's work.)  Nashville will always be my favorite Altman but he was certainly in peak form here as well.  Quibbles:  you'll strain your eyes and ears.  Many of the scenes are shot very darkly and the soundtrack is frequently low and muddy.
1	Beautiful. Incredible scenery, wonderful depiction of Michner's historic epic.  Must for your classic CD collection
1	INDEED!. Very,VERY good stuff. I have been a fan of the (shall we say..)loud stuff for quite some time.Everybody gets a turn at bat. In the 70's it was The Saints, The Nils, The Buzzcocks,Ramones,Pistols,Clash,Handsome Dick Manatoba and the gang....the whole hybrid thrash/political/sex starved/straight edge -Bad Brains,Black Flag,Husker Du,Minor Threat,GBH,Fear,Circle Jerks,Anti System,Misfits,Scream and so on.I love the film because it had heart and it had an insight on its own implosion. I happen to like a lot of the bands that were on this tape(I am from NY BTW)The Posies needed to be grouped in there because they played with (and are friends with) Nirvana, which brings me to my next comment...If you don't like the sound--"FINE"-but when you are happy because someone is dead,you are a messed up person. If you like the Hollies,good for you. I like their stuff as well,but to wish death upon someone because you think the movie "sucks" is absolute rubbish.These bands kick ass on their own terms and did not ask to be filmed. I for one am happy they were
1	Great cast, Great script, Great movie. A solid script backed up by a great cast, John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John c. McGinley, Alfred Molina, Amanda Peet and more, are all outstanding. Brilliantly directed by James Mangold who also directed Copland, Girl Intrerupted and Walk The Line, this is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. To say too much about the script would possibly give it away, but in the style of the Agatha Christie's novels 'Ten Little Indians' and  'Murder on the orient express', where people start dying in suspicious circumstances and later they find out they are all connected in some way. In this movie we have ten complete strangers stranded at a desert motel for the night. Sure enough people start getting killed, there is a lot of finger pointing and plenty of twists along the way to keep the audience engaged. The music score is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the whole movie. Special features include bonus trailers, an on the set documentary and 2 very informative and interesting commentaries. One by the director and one by the writer, the latter being the better of the two. The disc features both cinema and DVD versions, although the DVD version only includes 2 extra scenes that last no longer than 30 seconds each. The only fault I have of the movie is that it seems too much time was spent in the first half of the movie bringing the characters together and laying a foundation forcing the ending to seem rushed through to conclude the movie within the 90 minutes, instead of the film being possibly edited longer. All up though, one of the best thrillers you will ever see. I have seen it many times and it is still good even when you know the ending.
1	One of the Finest Films Ever Produced. I saw Career Girls when it was released several years ago, and I am buying the video because the film has been re-playing in my brain ever since.  Career Girls, like Secrets and Lies, is slice-of-life filmmaking at its  very best. There is not one wasted frame in the film, and for every moment  that is grim, there are two that amuse, stimulate and uplift. This film  should be on the top-ten list of every intelligent film buff, or for that  matter of any one who enjoys timeless works of art
1	The Nun's Story. Audrey Hepburn is one of my favourite movie stars & her portrayal of a nun is wonderful.We are taken into the world behind the convent walls to follow her journey to becoming a nun with all it's challenges  to the decision to remain a nun or join the resistance.
1	FUNNY. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY FUNNY! STEVE MARTIN AND GOLDIE HAWN WORK REALLY WELL 2GETHER. THIS COMEDY KEPT ME INTRESTED FROM BEGINNING TO END. I ENJOYED IT ALOT
1	Delightful Sitcom Bears Ozu's Depth and Then Some. Flatulence seems to be an odd way of lending a framework to a film, but leave it to filmmaking master Yasujiro Ozu to use it as a metaphor for the meaninglessness of "small talk" between people who cannot be candid with one another. The title of this 1959 movie, "Ohay (Good Morning)", is indeed the salutation but also from Ozu's perspective, a symbolic expression of how the Japanese avoid confrontation and put a strong value on etiquette. One of Ozu's late period color films, this is a very cute comedy which on the surface, seems like an extended episode of "Leave It to Beaver" especially in exhibiting the speedy Americanization of Japan since WWII. Even the color palette seems to evoke the muted McCarthy-era colors of the Universal comedies release around the same time. What remains consistent are Ozu's signature visual compositions - the use of the hillside to place the horizon in the middle of the frame, the use of silhouettes against the hillside, the movement of figures darting between the identical homes.Set in a shoebox-tight housing community in Tokyo, the plot seamlessly interweaves the activities of five households - four of the more traditional variety and the fifth, a young beatnik couple who has the prized possession of the neighborhood, a TV set, which draws all the children in like clockwork after school. In the meantime, the housewives discover their association dues are missing and in "Peyton Place"-style, rumors swirl that the culprit is the woman who just bought a washing machine. Further subplots involve an unemployed English teacher, who can only speak banalities to the woman he loves; an older unemployed man who habitually gets drunk at the local bar and can't find his own home since they all look alike; and the funniest about two young brothers, the older particularly obstreperous in furiously sharing his all-too-perceptive observations of the adults - and practicing a strike of silence when their parents refuse to buy a TV set. Of course, that doesn't prevent the brothers and their friends from playing competitive rounds of "pull my finger" - a tap on the forehead yields a forced fart.The performances are charming and quite undemanding with several members of Ozu's regular troupe present - Chishu Ryu and Kuniko Miyake (the father and older son's wife in "Tokyo Story") as the put-upon parents of the TV-demanding brothers; Haruko Sugimura (the petty daughter in "Tokyo Story") as the accused dues pilferer; and Toyoko Takahashi (the Onomichi neighbor in "Tokyo Story") as another of the gossipy housewives. As the young people unable to articulate their feelings for each other, Keiji Sada is the English teacher and Yoshiko Kuga is the boys' shy aunt, who couriers the documents for translation. And as the brothers, 13-year old Koji Shitara plays Minoru and seven-year old Masahiko Shimazu is Isamu, the latter particularly adorable when mimicking his older brother. This movie is certainly not in the class of "Tokyo Story" or "Floating Weeds", but I doubt if Ozu intended it to be. It's just a gentle, well-coordinated, sometimes hilarious poke at Japanese cultural traditions, a parable masquerading as a family comedy. Personally this is the Ozu film I can relate to the most since it speaks to my generation of Japanese-born Americans. The DVD package from the Criterion Collection is surprisingly sparse - no audio commentary, no trailer - but the video transfer and sound quality are excellent
1	Un box Revisited. This Amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it. They should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out. Could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and I don't see how to download it again.Update: Most of the problems I experienced were with my Sattelite connection. After 175 MB they start to throttle the speed way down. I upgraded and this helped. I can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours. If you are having trouble read your sattelite "fair access" policy
1	Entertaining camp classic is enjoyable "sand and sandals" epic... MARIA MONTEZ, JON HALL and SABU made some very entertaining Technicolor "sand and sandals" epics at Universal and this DVD restoration showcases them in brilliant Technicolor.It's strictly Saturday afternoon matinee stuff, nothing to really ponder in the way of complex plots--just the usual good vs. evil with Hall coming to the rescue of beautiful princess Montez in her usual damsel in distress kind of role.Exquisitely photographed on desert sands, it's exotic fun fare for adults and children with lots of eye candy to keep things interesting. TURHAN BEY is effective in a brief role but it's Montez and Hall who keep the story moving along at a lively pace. Well worth viewing and nostalgic fun for fans of the Universal series starring this trio of stars
1	Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST!. The Immortal Yi Soon Shin is the BEST drama I have seen ever. Korean, American, doesn't matter! This is better than anything I have ever seen on TV or in the movies. Hollywood cannot touch this one! Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that!My whole family, kids and all, watched this with me and loved it!I can see why Yi Soon Shin is Korea's hero and why other countries teach his methods
1	Edge Of Your Seat. I saw this in the theater when it first came out. Had to have a copy because it is so gripping. Look at world events in the middle east today and you will appreciate this film even more
1	Adrift on the Prairie. In 1958, a kill-happy Charlie Starkweather and his 13 year-old girlfriend Caril Ann Fugate came boiling out of high plains Nebraska to terrorize a section of the country that seldom appears on the 6 o'clock news. Behind, they left a trail of 11 dead bodies. If Charlie saw you, he killed you with no more thought than throwing away a gum wrapper. In the slumberland of 1950's suburbia, it was almost as if Beaver Cleaver had gone mad. So what  was the point of all the merciless blood-letting. Malick's terrific little movie makes the point that in fact there was no point. It really amounted to something to do. A way to escape a dead-end job with no prospects, no respect, and who knows, maybe other teen-agers would make a comparison with that reel rebel idol James Dean. In a bit of cultural perversity, it seems Starkweather succeeded. The night of his execution, young people gathered outside the prison gates. In his own way, he did make the movies, just like his idol.This is a disturbing film that thoroughly deglamorizes the two fugitives and is a long, long way from Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde". Kit (Martin Sheen) and Holly (Sissy Spacek) are not just callow kids; they're dull, unimaginative, and barely aware of the gravity or consequences of what they do. Holly lives in a detached world, where her story-book narration contrasts vividly with the mayhem that surrounds them. She shows no tears or remorse for her slain father, creating instead little fantasies about a rollercoaster ride with a "hell-bent type boy". It's all really just a fairy-tale dream, after which she'll wake up and go to the prom. Boyfriend Kit Carruthers has all the moral sensibility of a happy-go-lucky clam. He kills because he really can't think of anything else to do. Besides, how else could such a hopeless dead-ender  become an outlaw legend in his own time, marking the spot of his capture with an improvised rock pile. There's absolutely nothing here to romanticize, and it's to Malick's credit that he doesn't.Too bad Malick disappeared from movie-making. He had a rare alertness as to how the natural world shapes people's behavior. Here, Holly and Kit are adrift on the vast empty prairie of the horizonless Midwest (actually, southeastern Colorado). The dreary landscape stretches out to a nowhere that mirrors the fugitives' own inner emptiness and existential void. At least the act of fleeing provides proverbial "meaning" to an otherwise barren existence. There are many nice touches. Notice how Kit and Alan Vint's police deputy develop a budding friendship-- just a couple of good- ole'-boys who might have gone hunting together, except one of them doesn't shoot rabbits. In fact, the states of Nebraska and Wyoming treated the spree like a Soviet invasion, calling out the National Guard to reassure panicked civilians. Malick brings in the Guard formations casually and impressively at film's end, when the real impact trailing behind these two malt-shop fugitives is finally revealed. In 1958, wholesale killing was still the prerogative of adults only.Over the years a number of films have been based on this mindless binge. In my book, Malick's remains the most compelling
1	Pretty Pretty.... I love this movie. Maybe it's because it seemed so risque as a kid, or maybe it's because Jane hates it. Whatever, it's great fun. Sure the script leaves much to be desired. And yea, the special effects suck. It was 1968, what do you want? But that only adds to its charm. It's a funny movie, more on the silly side. This is true camp and if you like campy flicks, this one has to be in your collection
1	Never explain, never apologise..... This is yet one more brilliant film in the Lynch universe.  I've loved everything he's done (even Twin Peaks: Firewalk With Me), and he seems to get better with each film.  This film was originally a TV pilot (!), but it was rejected by ABC as "too weird".  That really isn't too surprising.  So David got additional funds, and made into one of his best films.  I don't want to hear any explanations of what actually occured in the film.  All I know is that it did occur, and I felt it, whatever it was.  That's good enough for me and the rest of the world.  Even Roger Ebert liked this film, even though I think it was because the majority of critics adored it, and Ebert didn't want to be in constrast to the crowd (Ebert has always been hostile to Lynch's work).  The performances are superb all around, with kudos going to Justin Theroux as "the director", who has a great scene with studio heads about "the girl".  Love the golf club!  I'm looking forward to Inland Empire, a 3 hour helping from Mr. Lynch.  Lovely.
1	"I luuurve it, I loave it, I luff it",. This story of three sisters, their lives, loves, and struggles is delight from the beginning to the end. Along with three unforgettable women, Hannah (Mia Farrow, the eldest sister, a devoted wife and mother, a loyal sister to sensual Lee (Barbara Hershey) and artistic, neurotic and clueless Holley (Diane Wiest, a perfect match to Allen's characters), we meet their actors parents. Maureen O'Sullivan, "Tarzan's Jane", Mia Farrow's real life mother plays the flirting and drinking mother of three sisters. There are also three men in the sisters' lives: Elliot (Michael Caine), Hannah's husband who understands how great Hannah is but he is lusting after Lee, who is with a much older, wiser, talented but misanthropic and isolated artist Frederick. Here is also Mickey (Woody Allen) Mickey, the former husband of Hannah, a hypochondriac TV producer who lives in constant fear of death and tries to find meaning of life. All stories interweave effortlessly and seamlessly showing Allen's unique writing gift. As almost always in Allen's films, there are two important characters, his favorite place on Earth, Manhattan, NY and the music he adores. And as always, they add to the many many delights of this wonderful, sparkling, clever, ironic, sweet, funny and dramatic miracle.Excellent!
1	Lighten up, people. .C'mon, people. Lighten up. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but this is a good movie. I do agree the use of colored filters was grossly overworked. It's like garlic: a little is a little good; a lot is not a lot of good, and the director definitely over-did it. But to criticize Rossano Brazzi's accent because it was Italian instead of French is being quite picky. He was supposed to lend a certain "continental" air to his role, and he did. And musicals are supposed to be fantasies of a sort, so you have to use some imagination. If you want realism, you shouldn't look to a musical, after all, how many times have you been around a group of people in real life who suddenly broke into song and dance, all perfectly choreographed, of course?The thing I found absolutely DUMB, DUMB, DUMB was the anti-racism message. I thought it was hokey in 1959 when I first saw this movie, and I still do. Neither incident made sense. First, we have sweet and petite Nellie Forbush from Little Rock, AR, falling in love with a Frenchman; but when she finds out he was once married to a native woman (now deceased) and the two kids she adores were the native woman's, a racist streak a mile wide goes up her spine. Kinda hard to believe, even for 1959.Then there is Lt. Joe Cable from Philadelphia, PA. He meets and falls instantly (if not sooner) in love with an absolutely gorgeous native girl. He sweeps her into his arms, sings "Younger Than Springtime", and kisses her. Later he makes other visits to her, and they swim in a swimming hole, hugging and kissing underwater. There not being any jewelry stores on the islands, he gives her his family heirloom watch that his father and grandfather carried in prior wars. Now, one would naturally think this was leading up to a marriage proposal, and it did, but not by Cable  . . .  by Liat's mother. He suddenly realizes  . . . guess what!!! . . . HER EYES ARE SLANTED and their children will have slanted eyes! Dang that racist streak!Although these inconsistencies don't make sense to me, perhaps I should use my imagination; after all it is a musical.The one thing I found offensive is the notion that only whites can be racists. But that's Hollywood . . . always beating up on its own who made it rich.I checked this movie out of the local library. You might check yours if you decide to watch it. I'm not sure I'd buy it.
1	Still lovely. I love this little story of the relationship between two sisters. The performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting. It still gets me :
1	Absolutely riveting!. No this isn't Courtney of Friends, but once you get past that - this is MUST WATCH TV!  While the show has content that can be shocking, it is so well written and edited it all fits.  It is definitely a sequential drama and makes much more sense watching the episodes back to back.  That fleshes out the characters so you start to care about and understand them.  Courtney shows her acting chops best at those moments when she is silent and lets her expressions say it all because sometimes her dialog is a bit stilted.  The best character is the functional schizophrenic photographer, Don Konkey.  He is exhibits an endearing combination of weirdness, loyalty, insight and sweetness to become the break-out star of this series.  If you only watched one episode and wrote this one off - go back and watch a few back to back and you may just find yourself addicted.
1	Excellant Collection. This is excellent DVD video collection. Very good picture quality and sounds. Worth to purchase it. Do not think twice
1	hot, hot, hot. Jeremy Irons has an affair with his son's fiancee Juliette Binoche, and becomes obsessed with her. Great erotic scenes, though not a lot of skin is shown, follow his obsession which leads to their affair being discovered, then tragedy.  The ending sees Irons' character as withdrawn and alienated from everyone, wondering: was it worth it?
1	The other side of Love. This is a pretty amazing movie, that does get graphic in nature and crosses the line in parts of what is art and what is not. Very good story in which Caroline Ducey goes out looking for love when her boyfriend, Sagamore Stevenin refuses to pay any attention to her. Caroline's character finds love in many different forms, men and means. From picking up a lover at a bar (Rocco Siffredi), to finding an older man into S&M, to having a quickie on a set of stairs by a total stranger (which I think is the best segment). A great film from Catherine Breillat. Also check out her 2003 masterpiece, 'Anatomy of Hell', which also stars Rocco Siffredi.
1	Great book plot adapted to video. I had read "The Winds of War" before I saw the miniseries. It is not usual for a movie script to convey what makes a book great but this not the case with "The Winds of War". Robert Mitchum plays a great role as a naval officer who sees himself, due to incredible multi-language capability, serving in naval intelligence in Europe and visiting the hot spots of that continent during the late 1930`s; like Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Soviet Union, United Kingdom ect. His younger son`s role plays out like the young are and how blinded they can be by love. His wife and her uncle roles are well played and show us those people who still think that a river will not be flooded even though they can hear the water rushing down its course. All the roles are well played. A good miniseries.
1	Karloff shines in duo role. Karloff once again shows us what an incredible actor he was in playing both brothers in this classic. Well thought out story and good supporting cast make this one a classic. Rivals Universal's monster movies of the same era
1	A very great Film: The Live Performers are Excellent ! *****. This film takes you back to a time you have lived in before or wished you had. The groups and performers in this film are simply outstanding * Little Richard is at his all time best !! He may have never looked any better than when he was in this film * Of course Jane Mansfield is perfect for the role. She was quite the presence throughout and captures your heart with her warm down home character that only wants to settle down and have a home. If your nostalgic though - This is the film for you - The soundtrack is a real 5 star production !! Highly recommend you view this and draw your own opinion. It isnt really a dramatic masterpiece but it is like A Hard Days Night was for it's capture of time - for the Fab four - This film allows a similar feeling of nostalgia in that sense - A place in history when the performers are on - Thank you ****
1	Probably the Best Drama Series Ever Made. I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out
1	A Very Good And Suspenseful Thriller!. I remember watching this film when it first came out in a theatre in Manhattan Beach, California. [During a time when you got two films for the price of one] I remember how fascinating the film was, and wondering if microbes were that bad. Not understanding everything the film discussed, I did know that something terrible had happened in a town in New Mexico. Everybody but a baby and an old man had been killed. But why did these two humans survive? [No Spoilers]Moreover, when the Doctors who are assembled at a secret bio-hazard facility, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force, try and figure out what danger Earth is in due to this new microbe, I sat riveted to my seat. I was thrilled at how the directors and special effects people were able to make a film that even a young teenager could enjoy. In their race to contain a microbe that has been picked up by a satellite falling back to earth, the actors as scientists in the film created an atmosphere of suspense and dread that stayed with me even after I had left the theatre with my older brothers.The way in which the film is handled is intelligent. There is no silly dialogue and used up time. These scientists make you feel as if the entire human race is going to be determined by either their success or failure. And that is why this film has stood the test of time. There is no CGI in this film, yet when you see the microbe and the computer systems at work, you get a feeling that this is really happening. At least it felt that way as a young boy. This film is highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5
1	Informative. Nice little video for my Zen during my long wait at the doctor's office.  Confucius overcame many difficulties
1	Funny,Funny,Funny. Even though this is about 4 years old, it is extremely halarious.  I've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy. The first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another. I love this guy
1	"How's Jesus look to you now Bob?". This is a classic western and one of Sam Peckinpah's greatest. I found the dialouge and the chemistry between James Coburns Pat Garrett and Kris Kristoffersons Billy the Kid to be mesmerizing. Kristofferson was very young in this part and fairly inexperienced as an actor but it doesn't show one bit. The costumes and the period are portrayed perfectly. The characters are dirty, crash, and wild. There are many colorful characters portrayed by a lot of famous character actors that you have probably seen in a ton of movies. Slim Pickens is also here in a brief but memorable role. The Kid and Garretts friendship is what holds the movie together and even though they don't show their early outlaw years together they don't have to. You can feel that the two have a long relationship and that their friendship runs very deep.Check this movie out if you want to see a great western and just a plain great piece of movie making
1	Is Rob Schneider Funny? Yes, he's very very funny. Rob Schneider and his sense of the absurd really resonatewith me.. some people might not find him funny or findhis comedy to be somewhat degrading... to me... this justmakes him that much funnier!!
1	tati looks like a 1950s chuck jones cartoon -- but thats good!. jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot. while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism (highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled "conveniences" and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain), it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long, and several scenes (notably the garden party) would have benefited by judicious paring. still, the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy.
1	Awesome. The Lord of the Rings movies made superstars out of dozens of actors and actresses.  Many have gone on to star in movies that made lots of money, but without the awards and critical recognition of the LOTR movies.  Not so with Viggo Mortensen.  Right after LOTR he followed with this awesome adventure story by Disney.  Coming out the summer after Pirates of the Caribbean, this was supposed to be Disney's next big live-action, summer adventure hit.  Unfortunately, it flopped at the box office.  Luckily, it has made a comeback on the DVD market, which is where this reviewer saw it.  All in all, it is a great movie, and probably one of the best live-action movies Disney has produced in a long while; judging from its ratings here on amazon and on imdb.com.In short, this movie is about Frank Hopkins, half-white, half-native american horserider who is mired in middle-age guilt and self remorse.  Along comes an opportunity for a change in scenery - a trip to the Arabian desert for a race.  Frank takes the challenge with his horse Hidalgo and of they go.  The race across the Arabian desert tests both rider and horse, and introduces them to a cast of characters that only an accomplished movie studio like Disney could have created.  We have the strong-willed girl full of innocence and inner strength, a fierce father and tribe leader who suffers no insults to his honor or intelligence, a backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until the final death, a seductive beauty willing to win at any costs, an arrogant prince with no moral bounds, etc, etc...  It all reminds our protagonist of his days in Montana!  During the course of the race, which Frank and Hidalgo win of course; both of them are tested to the limit.  The movie ends on a triumphal note for both.  The rider redeems his guilt by freeing Hidalgo from human ownership forever, and freeing his consciensce of past betrayals.The soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is realistic, and for once, a movie set in a foreign land that actually uses actors from that area speaking the language of that area!  My compliments to Disney and the cast and crew of this movie.  I highly recommend it to all audiences from teenagers on up
1	The One N Only -Gigglez. I love this movie i can relate to it in soo many ways...thats where i got my nickname(giggles).I can really relate to Sad Girl .My friends and i all love this movie cant stop watching it..we all relate to it, like mousie,sadgirl,whisper,sleepy,ernesto,blueeyes.We enjoy it.Every one should see it because the stuff that happen do happen in real life
1	Great for kids or adults. This movie was a cute movie for the whole family. I would suggest it to add to your holiday collection
1	From Angst to Art. Vincent Van Gogh is wildly popular today in ways he could have never imagined:  his work is on post cards, in massive coffee table books, and on T-shirts, and he's even venerated in a pop song by Don MClean.  Thankfully, this film by Paul Cox presents a more realistic view of Van Gogh, reminding us of the artist's anguish and the very great difficulty he had coming to terms with his sadness and inadequacies.  Cox shows Van Gogh's need to give shape to his suffering through art.  Van Gogh's life is rendered through his own words, from his letters, read by John Hurt, and through still imagery of the artist's sketches and paintings.  These still images are interspersed with gorgeous nature shots, interiors, and the occasional effective recreation of spaces that inhabit Van Gogh's paintings.  A really big bonus to this DVD is the interview with Paul Cox, in which you see how Cox's life somewhat parallels Van Gogh's in terms of childhood unhappiness, loneliness, and the need to express himself through imagery.  This interview will appeal especially to artists because it is so inspiring.Cox reminds the viewer what art IS and why it is created and explains to us why there is so much mediocrity in film.  Indeed, Cox's views on the need to rise above mediocrity are very similar to Van Gogh's.
1	"Hiroshima, Mon Amour" reflects image and sound, past and present; the actual and the remembered. His film was a bit puzzling, but, at the same time, a compromise, a promise, a pledge to human society... It is too daring by its conventional moral standards, distinguished in the way it was done, written, made and executed... Alain Resnais does not neglect the blast of Hiroshima by wrapping it with a simple love-affair."Hiroshima, Mon Amour" is about the fortitude of man, with its mental and physical power... Alain Resnais and his writer-collaborator Marguerite Duras combined a love story with an anti-bomb story... They carry out the horror of Hiroshima and the sorrow of a lost first love...Hiroshima is a tragedy that shocks us, while the story of love in Nevers makes us cry. The story of Nevers does not trivialize the story of Hiroshima... We gasp at the tragedy of Hiroshima as we weep over the tragedy at Nevers... We contemplate a cosmic and a personal problem at the same time."Hiroshima, Mon Amour" is a kind of film that has great technical ability, illustrating hypothesis plus fact...There is a close-up of Emmanuelle Riva , who has just glanced at Eiji Okada, asleep... Suddenly there is a brief flash-cut of the body of a wounded young man lying in approximately the same position in another place. Resnais' camera moves like a stream from the present to the past and back to the present... It cuts back to Riva's face, and then back to Okada asleep, and in that split second the technique of the subliminal flash cut, used to describe a character's state of mind, is born. This cut is the key to the film, for it is the man whom she calls 'Hiroshima' who reminds her of her lover at Nevers. It is the tragedy of his race that reminds her of the small tragedy of her life...This identification is carried through in the most neurotic moments of her recitative, when she looks at the Japanese and speaks to him as if he were her German lover of fourteen years before..."Hiroshima, Mon Amour" reflects image and sound, past and present; the actual and the remembered; Hiroshima (a city of neon) and Nevers (a city of gray stone); the personal and the cosmic; a man and a woman; concern for the individual and concern for mankind... Nice film especially for Duras fans.
1	A &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation for Monty Python. This is Monty Python at their very best.  Very little of the amusing but confusing sketch comedy that can be so hit or miss with American audiences.  This is a collection of their  material that appeals to the general  public.  This needs to be re-released so that people can get a chance to  see how delightful this comedy troupe was
1	A documentary snapshot of Russian military life. Some may be looking for deep symbolism in "100 Days".One reviewer called it surreal.It is very realistic actually, almost a documentaryabout a real problem in Soviet and Russian society:low morale and brutal treatment of recruits in anArmy dogged by a failed war in Afghanistan and thecollapse of the Soviet Union. To this day today'sRussian military has faced accusations of atrocitiescommitted in Grozny, Chechnya, which had beentragic for both Russians and Chechens.There have been Red Army scandals involving thedeaths of young men at the hands of criminallysadistic officers and NCOs. Drug abuse, alcoholand even male prostitution have been known to occuron Army bases.In one incident, commanding officers got recruitsto perform sexual services for a third party whilethe officers took payment. There have been rapesand desertion and suicide is not any surprisingevent.Just to escape the stultifying army environment,recruits had been known to get high off theirboot polish. Many have gone blind from suchdangerous activity.Viewers of "100 Days" who attempt to make sense ofall the nudity and strange broken down landscapeshouldn't trouble themselves too much. Such placesand activities literally did exist and were not suchuncommon sites around 1990.The boys rubbing eachother down nude is not justsome bizarre symbolism. Men of all ages did andstill do rub eachother down in the age old Russiantradition of the "Banya" or communal bath and sauna.To some Westerners it may look "gay" but it reallyis a traditional Russian cultural phenomenon.The broken down, abandoned looking landscape wasnot a surreal movie set designed for effect. Sovietarmy bases were horribly dilapidated as much of Sovietsociety was at the point of collapse.The translations are indeed peculiar as one review pointsout.The original Russian title "Sto Dnej Do Prikaza" shouldactually be translated as "A Hundred Days 'Til Orders Arrive"(i.e. Orders to get discharged or move on to anotherplace)The producers maybe should have prefaced the film with somebackground on Soviet/Russian society and culture back in 1990so the realistic episodes of the film would not seem meaninglessand "surreal.
1	Gable Rules as Ford Looks On. Great to have MOGAMBO on DVD. It looks good. Not your usual John Ford film from my view. Clark Gable is the man and really he seems to have more effect on the look of this film.  Good loves story flows tailored for Gable no doubt. Good one in all.
1	Good clean fun. Boy, let me tell you, if you are trippin on some good acid, this movie will make perfect sense.  I was a little confused until Ben Franklin made his amazing cameo and tied the whole movie together.  With not-so-subtle references to child slavery and sexual abuse appearing all to often, it keeps the watcher guessing.  In closing, the only thing I enjoy more than watching this movie, is watching this movie on shrooms.  Thanks to this movie, I now know the true meaning of newyears
1	Un box Revisited. This Amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it. They should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out. Could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and I don't see how to download it again.Update: Most of the problems I experienced were with my Sattelite connection. After 175 MB they start to throttle the speed way down. I upgraded and this helped. I can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours. If you are having trouble read your sattelite "fair access" policy
1	VERY CLOSE. After watching this video I examined the Bible and it is very close to the scriptures in accuracy.  It helps give the Bible life so that you can see the reality of creation, and vividly picture these true events that occured thousands of years ago in our history.  This is truly a video the whole family can enjoy together
1	Quinn and Hayworth's Pasadoble remains one of the movie's best remembered moments... 'The Mark of Zorro' and 'Blood and Sand' confirmed Rouben Mamoulian's enduring concern with drama conveyed through movement of characters and camera... The former was a rousing, deliciously ironic swashbuckler; the latter an adaptation of Ibaez's story about a simple country boy whose success as a matador leads him into temptation and towards a violent early death... Rudolph Valentino had scored one of his biggest success with 'Blood and Sand' in 1922, and the same story served as a Tyrone Power vehicle nineteen years later...Color, and Mamoulian's almost choreographic direction, turned the motion picture into an exquisite melodrama, where all the passes and swirls of the bullring were vividly depicted: The parade of the bullfighters and their entourage, the race of the vicious predator into the arena, the matadors flashing their yellow and pink capes...Rita Hayworth blood-red lips and scarlet fingernails, contrast the cool colors of her Spanish mansion, and show her off to glittering advantage...In her sensuous screen Pasadoble with Anthony Quinn, she looks sensational in her rose evening gown, symbolic of the Spanish bullfight flavor...The arrogant and passionate dance, based on Flamenco dancing that characterizes the man as the matador and the lady as his red cape, is performed with style and surety... The colors, rose and green, are blended to perfection with the amazing prowess of an appealing couple in tune with the balanced perfection of shapes and the sweeping movements of Rita Hayworth...Quinn is perfect for redoing old Valentino roles... He always demonstrated his grace and remarkable agility on the dance floor... This sequence remains one of the movie's best remembered moments...Mamoulian begins the film with a 30 minute prologue, establishing the characters ten years before the main narrative...Juanillo, just a little boy with fire, vigorously illiterate but possessing his father's passion for bullfighting, is seen by night currently taking the bullfighting world by storm... Not least for his exceptional brave and agile style of fighting but also for his age... Juanillo adores the art of bullfighting... Hr runs off to Madrid with his boyhood friends, Manolo, Nacional Pablo and La Pulga...After winning a certain reputation as a 'flat-footed novillero,' Juan (Tyrone Power) returns years later to Seville to marry his childhood sweetheart, Carmen Espinosa (Linda Darnell - a voluptuous beauty with perfect complexion), and brings her to live in his luxurious home where he has installed his mother (Alla Nazimona) and his sister, Encarnacion (Lynn Bari).Then he goes on to become the 'first matador in Spain' showing his individual personality by the combination and variations of his passes... Juan brings the bull past his body with the elegance of a premier ballet dancer, making it seem effortless and beautiful...As his popularity climbs Juan's entourage of hangers-on increases joining his boyhood friends Nacional (John Carradine), Manolo de Palma (Anthony Quinn), La Pulga (Michael Morris), Pablo Gomez (Charles Stevens), Sebastian (William Montague), and his loyal dresser, Garabato (J. Carrol Naish) who left the ring just as he came in to it, 'without a peseta.'But all is not so perfect in the ranks of Juan's cuadrilla... Nacional is anxious to leave bullfighting for politics, and Manolo, jealous of Juan's success, wants to make his own name in the ring... And then there is the on-going feud Juan has been engaging in with Natalio Curro (Laird Cregar), the famous bullfight critic who had insulted the memory of his father...When Juan established himself as Spain's most important matador, Curro opportunistically affirms: 'At last Sevilla has a matador. The greatest matador of all history. The first man of the world. The day he was born, there was salt in the air, a great quantity of salt.'And at one of Juan's 'great afternoon', we are introduced to the stunning Doa Sol des Muire (Rita Hayworth) whose chief passion is bullfighting and, in particular, handsome matadors...The torrid Spanish beauty had little difficulty, in luring the new risen star away from his home...Falling under her tempting beauty, Juan begins an affair with her at the expense of both his faithful wife and his career... His skills as a matador go downhill and his bad attitude loses him all his once loyal friends...'Blood and Sand' is sensitively directed by Mamoulian and might be considered one of the greatest examples of Technicolor film-making... The film won an Oscar for Best Color Cinematography, and was nominated for Best Interior Set Decoration...
1	Refined but difficult. Rating and reviewing movies like these are often difficult for the average critic.  On one hand, they're done absolutely brilliantly done in ways that take one's breath away; on the other hand, how much credit can you give to a movie that is pure propaganda, especially propaganda for something the reviewer doesn't agree with?This "realistic re-enactment" of the events of October 25th, 1917, is actually anything but realism.  Instead, it is a harrowing and amazing Romantic experience.  This is not to say it's bad--it's brilliant!  The direction and editing on this film are much more refined than Eisenstein's previous and much-more-heralded film, Brenonsets Potyemkin (Battleship Potemkin), and it has a whole lot more symbolism and focus on literary devices.  His fast-paced cutting is not as disjunctive as previously; instead, it works to shock the viewer with the juxtapositions.  I don't think I shall ever get the quick back-and-forth cutting between that one soldier's face and the firing machine gun ever out of my mind.  It's just that powerful.This movie is so good, in fact, that it makes me proud to be a Bolshevik... and I'm not, not in any way or form!  How's that for being a powerful, well-done movie?  The Birth of a Nation didn't effectively make me proud to be a Klansman, for a comparison...Because of its intense political alignment, I can't see everyone appreciating this film.  There will always be those out there who say, "Ah, it's only Communist propaganda" (which is right) "so it's not even worth watching..." (which is wrong).  For those who are looking for a magnificent cinematic experience, however, this movie is a fine choice indeed.--PolarisDi
1	Rule of Law determines whether a Soldier is a barbarous or civilized. Defense argued, "Law does not exist in the Confederate prison.  Therefore, the Raiders are not guilty of breaking any law", "these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive", "only rebel law applies in the prison".   Outcries from other Union soldiers were heard, "we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics.  What about us?"  Prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men: 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft.    The military jury found the six Raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging.  The union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized.  Mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft;  however, once intolerance levels are hit,  a violent revolution transpires.  The raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial.  However, the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the Raiders.The "Great Escape" with McQueen probably took its plot from Andersonville.  The story line had a ton of similarities.Andersonville has a fair share of violence.   At one point the directors portrays the prisoners as Zoombies, in the land, of the walking dead.   Scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness, in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy, abhorrence of the injustices, and despair of the troops.  Heroism abounds, leaders reject traitorous offers to defect, form their regiment, about face, and march away from on looking Confederate Admiral making offer.  Factually, 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation, disease, and crime.  Inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water, over crowding of the prisoners, no prisoner exchange, and looting.  Andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value, as a civil war movie.  The characters were passionate, compelling, and captivating.
1	action, romance a winner. Bridget Fonda is outstanding in this role.  Good mix of action and romance.   I have recommended it to several friends and they all love it too.I also "love Nina".

1	A pirate you can't help but love. This movie entertained me as a child and still does today. Suzanne Pleshette & Dean Jones are great, but the constant scene stealing (as always) is done by Peter Ustinov. His dialogue works well with the special effects that were available at the time. You might forget for a moment that he's a ghost and then the movie shows the perspective from everyone else. Suzanne Pleshette's character is trying her best not to fall in love with someone that might be crazy and can't help herself. If you enjoy Disney movies, this one will entertain everyone. I love it.
1	Funny,Funny,Funny. Even though this is about 4 years old, it is extremely halarious.  I've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy. The first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another. I love this guy
1	Great video!. Another great Richard Scarry video.  This video teaches kids in a way that is interesting and fun for them...without being obnoxious for their parents!  We love it
1	"I need dogs". Free spirit Molly De Mora (Paula Marshall) is about to settle down and marry the conservative Keith Marks (James Denton) son of Senator Marks.There is just one caveat or maybe two. Molly wants to elope and warns Keith that the last thing he wants to do is to invite her feuding parents who have been divorced for 14 years.Warning not headed both father (Dennis Farina) and mother (Bette Midler) are forced to gather and nature takes it course. After an explosive confrontation we find where Molly gets her free spirit.This is where the fun begins as all the characters meet and mix to confront the situation.
1	Guaranteed to be one of the most thought-provoking films you've ever watched. There is little a reviewer can say about Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film DET SJUNDE INSEGLET ("The Seventh Seal") that hasn't already been said. Its plot of a knight playing chess with Death has been so widely alluded to or parodied that it securely has a place in the canon of classic films, and enough praise has been heaped on it that it's quite obviously a masterpiece.In spite of the inevitability of repetition, the film invites effusive comment. The struggles of the knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) to find meaning in his doomed life stands in the spotlight for most viewers on the first run throug, but Bergman's script is of such depth that there's always more thought-provoking facets to be found. Block is gripped by an existential crisis at the thought of death. His squire Jons (Gunnar Bjrnstrand) and the traveling couple and acting partners Jof and Mia (Nils Poppe and Bibi Andersson), on the other hand, each react differently to the mortal fate common to all. Which one should the viewer identify with? Or is it possible to find some other way of confronting the inevitable? Bergman claims that filming DET SJUNDE INSEGLET let him find peace, and if the film won't give comfort to all, it surely confronts all with a question that must be answered.Acting here is of the highest order. Gunnar Bjornstrand was commonly cast in severe, upright roles, for example as a priest in Bergman's later chamber film NATTVARDSGAESTERNA ("Winter Light"). Here, however, he plays a bawdy commoner who lives for wine, women, and song. While Bengt Ekerot generally continues the traditional portrayal of Death as a dark, threatening character, he adds just the right amount of droll humour to the role to comment on the Knight's search for meaning in an absurd world.And the climax, where the straightforward narrative fades and the theoretical musings of each character are made real, the Knight praying in torment and the Squire acting as his foil one last time but more convincingly than ever... well, it's a tour de force. One of the most memorable films I've ever seen, just like for so many of the rest of the reviewers here, DET SJUNDE INSEGLET is a must-see film
1	sound and picture quality is awful. buyers beware. I don't want to discuss about the movie. but the quality of the DVD was awfull. sound and picture both. picture quality was like that screener bootleg movies. criterion group unfortunately didn't do any restoration in this matter! and there is no special featues either. only movie perhaps direct from the original negavie and an english subtitle. that's all
1	Another underrated Billy Wilder sex comedy delight. I saw Billy Wilder's neglected KISS ME, STUPID (1964) two weeks ago on letterboxed DVD and cannot get it out of my head.  I have a special fondness for this movie that was panned by critics originally and condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency.  So some of my readers will find this sex farce smutty and unfunny; it has a PG-13 rating.You can probably tell from these sentences whether you will enjoy KISS ME, STUPID, which was filmed in B&W Panavision:  in the desert town of Climax, Nevada, Orville J. Spooner (Ray Walston) and Barney Milsap (Cliff Osmond) run the local gas station, give piano lessons, and are failed songwriters; Felicia Farr is Orville's likeable and patient wife.  Walston and especially Osmond are riotously funny.  And Kim Novak (in one of her best roles) plays waitress (and prostitute) Polly the Pistol at the Belly Button Cafe.  Location filming, for all of my Department of Defense friends, was done at Twentynine Palms, California one or two years after Stanley Kramer and company tore up the place for IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD,MAD WORLD.Many of Wilder's best comedies are adult masquerade sex farces, which is what this one also is.  Dean Martin (in a devastating self parody) basically plays himself to perfection.  His "Dino" is a Vegas entertainer with car trouble who gets waylaid in Climax and forced to listen to failed Gershwin songs (which are quite good, including "Oh the Live Long Day and the Long Lonely Night" and "Oh, Sophia, Be Mine") from Orville and Barney.The action gets hilarious (for me) when Polly becomes Dino's sex customer of sorts for the night, but later Dino ends up in Polly's trailer, where Mrs. Spooner is posing as Polly.  Unlike Wilder's flawed THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH (1955), where we don't believe Tom Ewell really sleeps with Marilyn Monroe, the sexual overtures are more satisfying here.  I believe that Dino does sleep with both Polly (at the Spooner home) and Mrs. Spooner (inside Polly's trailer).  In the cold light of dawn, as in the best Ernst Lubitsch masquerade farces, everyone goes back to their right partner and all eventually seems forgiven.Something about KISS ME, STUPID appeals to me, makes me laugh out loud as I watch it and listen to both Dean Martin's wisecracks and to the underrated (and previously unpublished) Gershwin songs, and especially enjoy Cliff Osmond's screwball dialogue.  All of the actors are wonderful and the script, by Wilder and Diamond, is refreshingly adult.  1964 was a time when the censorship board was starting to crumble.  The masquerade motif is skillfully handled, and the wide-screen compositions on DVD are excellent.KISS ME, STUPID is a wonderful and underrated comedy that certainly won't appeal to everyone, but I as least love it.  And if I make it sound funny, then it is probably an enjoyable Netflicks rental for you.
1	Sadness and Beauty. The Princess of Death loved one man - which is not allowed. Beautiful sounds enhance the beautiful scenes and lead you into the world consists of love, death, and life. The Princess of Death sacrificed herself for Orphee in the end. I cannot forget the final scene that she leaves
1	...When I was very small... This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).
1	A rare genre piece. Simply put, The Other is truly a slow moving story, but has a certain creepiness that tends to open the doorway to the imagination. Don't waste your time on the film until  you have read the book. There is a certain uncomfortable feeling you get while reading The Other, a stirring haunting feeling that starts at the base of your spine then travels upward while all the while building supense. I would have to recommend this book to those who have not experienced it's touch.Beware though, if this book is suddently coming back into print then one has to ask, is another remake on the horizon. Do yourself a favor, read the book, see the original film, and stay away from Hollywood's desire of remaking every classic movie into garbage
1	Bold, Tragic, and thought-provoking... Oh Nooooooooo!. It's tragic how some of Hollywood's greatest films are doomed from the start, by efforts to conceal the serious subject matter with confusing or misleading box covers, or by presenting subject matter that requires brain matter activity. I agree with all reviews of the well-delivered performances by the then virtually unknown Barton and Rockwell (at  least to me).  Barton's performance, akin to the seemingly natural talent of Dakota (please don't screw Dakota's head up... I'm counting on oscar performances after the awkward years -- but I  digress.) The beauty of the film was in what was not spelled out, like a novel that people still can't figure out why, is better than the movie. Aside from the short-lived ego rush of sharing the fact that you can read, it's the imagery unique to our own life experinces that makes a novel a personal experience, that often conflicts with the director's life experiences (plus he/she has more money for crack and other mind altering substances). Ok, my point! Our society's heinously counterproductive view of sex, sin, and alas child molestor profiling has taken us back at least 100 years. In 1914, the age of consent for sex was 10. NFW you say? Yeah way! Wrong, yes. Geared toward safe sex with kids --- bad. Lawn Dogs reminds us that the human mind is fully developed at age 8, and kids have intelligent, idealistic, regretless, and raw opinions, a need to be heard and understood, and guess what else? They like to touch their peepees, and they know it.  In 2006,  they still like to touch their  peepees, but society (and Mom and Dad) relieve them (to the long-term detriment of their children) of the ability to reason and manipulate their environment until at least 16. In essence, we discredit their abilty for rational thought with regard to sex,  but empower them with the ability to manipulate someone into jail, with the mere mention of the only crime that requires "no intent or forethought", and true or not, a life sentence of "societal periah". This movie struck a nerve -- ya think? We need to stop the "perves"! Mistake not my words for anything short of this. Lawn Dogs dares to go where few film makers dare, even if mostly left to us to conclude that molesters seldom meet our expectations and place of origin. We can get a better handle of what we are up against without the kneejerk reactions, mob thinking, and the removal of the concept of personal accountability for their innocent, but real actions, that can draw an unlikely and previously unblemished molester from his primative "Id-ish" shell. Like this film, it will require thought and above all honesty about what goes on in a child's mind where normal sexual curiousity is alive and well, and  about where we came from to arrive at this "civilized", yet God-alienating society. Ask  yourselves this question. Which is scarier? 28,000 (Ca only) registered sex offenders or "wienee waggers" all waiting to catch you with your guard down, or a few hundred [...] with long lascidious pasts, that you WILL recognize from a mile away clad in trenchcoats,  and  you wouldn't let your daughter have contact with a stranger anyway.  Sex offender is not synonymous with child molestor, except with the network NEWS. You'll remember this when your son or close relative is registered for hanging a BA from a bus on the way to a football game in college. Yaweah.
1	Heartwarming Family Entertainment. This is another of my childhood favorites. I never thought I would be able to find it on DVD. This is definitely a film to add to your collection
1	Best Potion for youthfulness. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. Meryl, Goldie, and Bruce work well off of each other, which is why the film was a success. Helen and Madeline each woman want Earnest. and they each seek eternal life when they find out about it. Helen and Madeline are both viscious women.This movie is a dark comedy. very funny. I reccomend this to everyone
1	More artistic than historic. Called "A breathtaking journey into the heart of darkness."The cinema tail of the conquest of Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) and how it might have been as they traverse the Amazon river (Filmed in Peru) in search of the mythical lost City of Gold.Some see it as real others see holes you can drive a truck through; Any way you see it this is a good place to start in the New German Cinema movement. A good choice of actors and great visuals. This is also an intense way to learn some German. The victim on the raft is full of arrows and he gets kicked before the revealing statement "er ist tot"
1	A little hokey, but all the elements were there. Not a great retelling of the story, some of the Hollywood magic gets in the way, but all the elements of Peter and the Wolf are captured.
1	A very popular Italian film. This review is for the Criterion collection DVD edition of the film."Bicycle Thieves" released in Italy as "Ladri di biciclette" is about a bill poster who's bicycle is stolen. The film chronicles the efforts of him and his young son in recovering the bicycle.This film won an honoary oscar for best foreign laguage film and is considered on of the greatest films ever made.The Criterion DVD edition is a double disc set.Disc one contains the film with an optional English dubbed trackDisc two contains "Working with De Sica" with various interviews with people involved with De Sica and scenes of his other films, "Life as It Is" a docunebtary on neorealism cinema in Italy, and a documentary on longtime DeSica colleague, Cesare Zavattini.The set also includes a booklet with other material.This is a very good film and the best DVD release available
1	Great Buy!. It was a great buy! Got the movie in great time, and there wasn't a thing wrong with it! =) Thanks

1	The last vestiges of the Old West. Steve McQueen is his pentultimate role before succumbing to cancer stars in the somber biographical film "Tom Horn". Horn, a legendary cowboy, Indian scout and wizard with a rifle rides his way into Wyoming territory near the turn of the 20th century.Cattle rancher John Coble played in an effective measured fashion by western veteran Richard Farnsworth recognizes his talent and hires Horn to work on his ranch.  He introduces him to the local cattleman's association which was been plagued by rustling.  They give him free reign and backing by the local marshall Joe Belle to rid the territory of the cattle thieves by whatever means deemed appropriate including death.The association soon tire of Horn's violent techniques and plan to get rid of him.  They railroad him without the backing of Farnsworth by accusing him of the murder of an innocent local youth who had been herding sheep.  A sham trial is convened to convict him of murder.The story of "Tom Horn" is representative of the transformation in our country from the days of the old west.  Horn is symbolic of an era that no longer fits within the shrinking frontier.  Horn love interest, a school teacher played by Linda Evans also forsakes him unwilling to be seduced into his now obsolete violent lifestyle.  The movie serves as a sad commentary on society's unwillingness to allow freedom and equality for those that don't fit a prescribed mold in a changing world.McQueen and Farnsworth were naturals for their respective roles.  Slim Pickens playing sheriff Sam Creedmore, as usual gives an authentic portrayal of a denizen of these times
1	Fun Film, interesting story to me. This is a fun film.  As long as you don't go into it expecting much, you will find it a good way to occupy your time.
1	A Flawed Masterpiece - Let's See a Remake. Frank and Julia's forbidden love affair was the focus of Hellraiser, but the cenobites stole the show. This time around the cenobites are given a lot more screen time. Dr. Channard, a man with dark obsessions, devotes his life to researching the infernal netherworld. Kirsty becomes his latest patient at his psychiatric hospital, and after hearing of the events that took place in the first movie, Channard decides to reanimate the evil Julia. He agrees to bring her victims so she can continue regenerating, and in exchange she will be his guide in the labyrinth that is Hell.Christopher Young's music is awesome. Loud, dramatic, and ominous - the movie's theme during the opening credits lets the viewers know what they're getting into. His music is also very significant during the scene when Tiffany solves the puzzle box. The music conveys Tiffany's childlike innocence and her sense of wonder as she handles and studies the box. The tone and speed of the music (as Tiffany manipulates the box) raises the tension to a fever pitch. Then, after a deafening silence, the movie's theme erupts as the gateway to Hell is unlocked, and the cenobites are once again freed to walk the Earth. Their spectacular entrance in this scene was even more impressive than in the first movie when they appeared after Kirsty solved the box. This scene is also when Pinhead delivers the most important line of Hellraiser II: "It is not hands that call us - it is DESIRE." But you need to hear Doug Bradley's delivery of that line for it to have any affect on you. That line may look laughable, but it is powerful and so significant because it speaks volumes about the nature of the cenobites. It seems the cenobites will not slaughter someone who solves the box UNLESS that person has a desire to see what happens when the box is solved - even if that person DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN when the box is solved. That would explain why they wanted to torture Kirsty in the first movie. And since Tiffany wanted to solve the box simply for the sake of solving the puzzle, she was spared. She had no idea anything would happen when she solved the box. That raises questions about the nature of the game - since the cenobites obviously knew it was Channard who called them, why didn't they go after him? Or did they think it was Kirsty who called them?Channard has no qualms at all when he has people killed, and yet he is a timid man. It is clear that he expects Julia to protect him from whatever unknown terrors are lurking in Hell. Channard ultimately finds what he is looking for - and pays a painful price. There is a cenobite battle in Hellraiser II, which was disappointing because it was so one-sided. There is a reason for this though, and in case you don't get it when you watch the movie, it's explained on the audio commentary.The DVD has an audio commentary by Ashley Laurence, director Tony Randel and writer Peter Atkins. Their commentary was very descriptive and informative. They gently poke fun at their mistakes, and this makes the commentary more enjoyable. Lord knows there were some glaring mistakes. But did anyone besides me notice the hostility that seems to exist between Randel and Atkins? The thought of them sharing a mutual dislike of each other and grudgingly doing this commentary together gives me perverse pleasure.I LOVED this movie up until Kirsty's reunion with Frank. From that point on this movie goes to hell (in a manner of speaking). It would have been nice if the script had dropped the dumb subplot of Kirsty looking for her father - even if that left no reason for the Kirsty character to be in this movie. It's near the end of the movie when Pinhead delivers his infamous line "Your suffering will be LEGENDARY - even in Hell." But even Pinhead's wit can't uplift the last half hour of this movie. But it was pretty funny to see the patients tearing the hospital apart - and just how did they get their hands on all those puzzle boxes? A different actress plays the Female Cenobite in Hellraiser II - she is less menacing in this movie, but is still entertaining. I was glad to see that she still had the bloodlust that was so evident in the first movie. But I would have preferred it if she didn't sound so nonchalant when she was talking, and I missed the wide-eyed stare of the actress from the first movie. The Chatterer has a different face at one point in Hellraiser II, which confused me until I heard the audio commentary. Personally, I preferred the Chatterer's original face. It was a real surprise when the Chatterer's identity was revealed. Without giving away too much, it involves a shocking scene - the murder of a child. The ending of Hellraiser II made no sense whatsoever, but I'm guessing that the filmmakers wanted to wait until the sequel to explain what's going on in Hell. And yes, as of this writing I have only seen the first two movies in the Hellraiser series.Hellraiser II also reveals Pinhead's background. Needless to say I was disappointed - I preferred to think of the cenobites as having Lovecraftian origins. I even dreamed up a whole history and mythology for the cenobites after seeing the first movie! But I loved the look of dread and despair on Pinhead's face (right before undergoing his `surgery') toward the end of the movie - you know that if someone like him is fearing for his own safety then he must be in serious danger. How the mighty have fallen. Buy the soundtrack and this DVD so that you can properly savour the first two-thirds of this movie
1	An eye opener. I don't think I've ever just sat and watched a movie and `got' it quite like this.  Maybe it's because every married couple goes through the feelings expressed in this film.  Laura Dern, Mark Ruffalo, Naomi Watts & Peter Krause star as two couples whose relationships are rattled by adultery.  These two couples have very different relationships yet are looking for exactly the same thing.Jack (Ruffalo) is a college professor married to Terry (Dern).  Terry loves Jack but Jack is falling in love with Edith (Watts) who is married to Hank (Krause) who doesn't love her but is attracted to Terry.  Jack and Edith fall into an affair that causes more pain to each of them then to their respective partners.  Watching Jack and Edith react to their mates after they've just been with each other, the tears, the looks, the concern in their eyes.  Hank in the meantime is looking for someone to cure his boredom with his wife, and Terry may be that woman, and since Jack's guilt is tearing him apart he encourages Terry and Hank's relationship in order to justify is infidelity.What Jack never banked on was realizing the love he had for his wife and his children.  After his wife sleeps with Hank, Jack is panged with regret and heartache as he watches his marriage fall apart, the marriage he felt he was tired of but in actuality it's the only thing he wants and needs.This movie is a wake up call for all of us who are falling out of love with our relationships, our lives in general and the ones we share it with.  It's brilliantly scripted and acted and flows wonderfully, delivering its point beautifully.  Watts and Dern are brilliant here and show so much feeling in all their words, in all their actions.  Honestly one of the best movie's I've ever seen and one that will stay with me for all time.
1	Playing in Charlie Brown Field. I remember when this 1st came out- at 9 years old, I had no idea what Arbor Day was all about (no, it's not &quot;the day all the ships come sailing into the arbor&quot;, as Sally Brown guesses in class and gets  laughed at!).  Peppermint Patty challenges old Chuck to a game at his new  field, which looks more like a garden than a baseball field (not exactly  Peppermint Patty's idea of a perfect field)!  Lucy makes poor Schroeder  promise her a kiss if she hits a home run!  Note: this was Vince Guaraldi's  final Peanuts score as he would pass away the following year
1	"Rivette?  Who is Jacques Rivette?"  He's a great filmmaker, that's who... The French New Wave is justifiably famous in cinema circles, schools, etc..  It is still talked about today.  When they mention the filmmakers that came from that school of filmmaking, they mention Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer, and Francois Truffault.  Rarely, if ever, do they mention Jacques Rivette.  When a friend of mine asked me my favorite French directors, I said Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, and Jacques Rivette.  My friend said "Rivette?"  Jacques Rivette's films stand out from any other French filmmaker of his time.  The other French New Wave filmmakers were prolific, whereas Rivette would make a film every few years.  Rivette's films are generally very long (the most extreme example being the film Out 1, which runs 12 1/2 hours, his other films run on average 3-4 hours), and concern themselves with the artistic process.  This is a 4 hour film (slightly longer than most Rivette films, but not the longest), but it unfolds magisterially and beautifully.  I saw it in a theater (with an intermission), and I was entralled.  It is one of Rivette's best films, and one that really shows the agony of artistic creation.  Creating art is a long and arduous process.  Kubrick compared his art, filmmaking, to trying to write War and Peace in a bumpy car ride, but when you've finished, it's an amazing feeling.  Its pacing is very slow and leisurely, but there isn't anything wrong with that.  I didn't feel bored, and I didn't feel that the film needed to be cut.  It's perfect the way it is.  The title is translated "a pretty nuisance", for those who are curious.  This film really captures that.  On a completely unrelated sidenote, I remember seeing this film with 2 couples in front of me.  The women liked it, but the men were bored out of their minds.  One kept shifting his head back and forth throughout the whole thing.  The men were probably just hoping to get laid afterwards, so that's why they went to see it.  You should really only see this film if you're a committed art cinema person.  Luckily, I am.  This is one of Rivette's best films, and he's a filmmaker that deserves to be better known.
1	A Film Noir Classic. I'm glad to see that the Sean Penn version of this movie has sparked an interest in the academy award winning original.There are the unmistakable marks of its time in this film.  It was made just after the end of WW II, and drawing analogies to dictatorships and American socialism are right from the times themselves.Broderick Crawford is really good as Willie, although some members of the supporting cast, especially John Ireland, are not up to the roles they play.  I also don't know whether the direction was as good as it could be;  there are some situations where the combination of writer/director is absolutely inspired, but I would not say that here.The ultimate destruction of the old order is, to me, the most fascinating element of this film.  Film Noir was all about that:  a breakdown in an old social order, with nothing but a void seeming to replace it.  That is much in evidence here exemplified, as it was in the book, by "Burden's Landing" and its complex blend of great principles lost, but old prejudices and injustices going away, too.It's a fascinating movie, and still quite watchable today.  I agree with some who say there that it is better than the remake, as good as the remake was..
1	Husbands & Wives. Woody Allen's 1992 film "Husbands and Wives" was released around the time we first heard the words Soon-Yi, which is ironic considering the subject matter of the film. "Husbands and Wives" is billed as a comedy, but is more of a drama. There are a few jokes, but there's nothing incredibly funny in the film. The movie is told like a documentary, featuring interviews with the characters and handheld cinematography. Allen and Mia Farrow play Gabe and Judy Roth, a couple who have been married for ten years and think everything is well. Then their two friends Jack and Sally (Sydney Pollack & Judy Davis) announce they are getting divorced, which causes Gabe and Judy to question the validity of their own marriage. As Jack and Sally move on (with Jack getting a much hotter younger woman and Sally lusting after Michael, played by Liam Neeson), Gabe and Judy begin to move farther apart. Gabe, a college professor, finds himself falling for a 20-year-old student named Rain (Juliette Lewis) and Judy finds herself, also, lusting after Michael. The movie is 106 minutes, but a lot of stuff happens in the film. This is not one of Woody Allen's best; it's not in the top 5 anyway. It's overwrought and is not his most entertaining. The performances are very good, especially Farrow, Pollack, and Davis. Juliette Lewis, meanwhile, has echoes of Mariel Hemingway in "Manhattan" in her performance. The cinematography and mock-documentary style of the film gets old after a while, with the former getting headache-inducing after a while. "Husbands and Wives" is a good study of marriage and infidelity. One critic (I don't recall which one it was) said that "Husbands and Wives" seemed like Allen trying to come to grips with the Soon-Yi debacle, but the ending here is quite different. "Husbands and Wives" has its merits, it's demerits...But it's a worthy Woody Allen film that's definitely worth watching.GRADE: B
1	Small-Scale Indie Has Its Charms and Nicely Etched Performances. I am hopeful that Katie Holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a Stepford wife for her couch-jumping husband-to-be. It's not that she strikes me as all that brilliant, but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as April Burns, a rebellious twenty-something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family's upstate home to a tenement in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Encouraged by her new boyfriend Bobby (who happens to be black), she invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment. There is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst-driven mother is dying of breast cancer, and this may be their last meal togetherDirected and written by Peter Hedges (who wrote the equally eccentric "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"), the story bounces back and forth between April's hazard-ridden preparation of the meal and the Burns family's chaotic journey to the city. While the family trip will remind you somewhat of this year's "Little Miss Sunshine", April's adventure consists mainly of meeting her motley neighbors, all strangers at first, to borrow a working stove for her turkey. Among others, she runs into a friendly black couple, an obsessive vegan and an elderly Chinese couple whom she teaches the origins of the holiday. On top of this is an odd, racially-driven storyline involving Bobby's need to buy a suit while being pursued by some suspicious characters.Shot in digital video by Tami Reiker and running only eighty minutes, the 2003 movie works toward an inevitable conclusion, but Hedges adds enough filmmaking idiosyncrasies to make it all seem more intriguing than it has any right to be. Among the supporting cast, Patricia Clarkson stands out as April's mother Joy, bringing a steely resolve as she crumbles under the surface. Oliver Platt is terrific as her put-upon husband Jim, as are Derek Luke as Bobby and Allison Pill as April's "perfect" little sister Beth. In little more than cameos which could have been excised, Sean Hayes plays a neurotic neighbor with a new stove and a pampered dog, while Dru Hill's Sisqo plays Bobby's friend Latrell. Hedges provides a nice commentary track on the 2004 DVD, which also includes a fifteen-minute making-of featurette
1	The master is in near top form. OK, I love Japanese film and Kurosawa is my favorite Japanese director, but even a newbie to film will be hooked. I loved every aspect of this film....script, cinematography, acting, score, choreography, sound, and of course - direction! This is the complete Japanese version, includes film not seen in the original US release.Criterion has put together a great package, the quality of this DVD makes it worth the price. Included in the specials feature is a terrific commentary track, one of the best I've heard covering every aspect of the film, Kurosawa, Japanese history and Japanese film history.Only negative I could consider is its somewhat stagy, slow opening act...I loved this scene, especial since most of it was new to me (not in original us release) but someone new to Japanese film might find it dull going and give up on the film before the momentum builds. It builds in the next scene!A great movie, in complete form,  presented in near pristine condition by a film master in top form. This is a 5 star release at any price! For those of you complaining about the price...rent it!
1	the land girls. Being English, I can relate to the trauma's of this wonderful movie. It is real life of war torn England in the face of defeat.They could not have picked better actors for this movie and the scenery of land and the farm are excellant..One could really &quot;&quot;smell&quot;&quot; the farm house and it's surrounds..wonderful!
1	GREAT UNDERRATED CLASSIC!. Its so sad that this movie didn't do better at the box office and more people don't know about it. Like most people say here, it should be a regular holiday classic. Despite the langauge which can be cleaned up for the kids and granny.I've seen it 30 times and I love it more and more each time.If you haven't seen it, you need to.... buy it you won't be dissapointed
1	hans christian andersen. Was a christmas present for my neice she loves the old Danny Kaye movies so it was the perfect addition for her collection
1	Funny,Funny,Funny. Even though this is about 4 years old, it is extremely halarious.  I've been waiting to see a good stand up comedy. The first 15 min is just one hilarious hit after another. I love this guy
1	A movie Jack Black was made for. Great movie!!!  I do not think any other actor could have done a better job.  He was perfectly cast for this movie.
1	CLARK AND KERR. Clark Gable zoomed back to the pre-eminent place he long held in Hollywood with this smash performance of Vic Norman, the attractive "huckster"; a radio advertising go-getter.  He takes with him the lovely English Deborah Kerr, who made her American film debut in this film from 1947.  Nearly everyone read the book by Frederic Wakeman back in the forties; it was very popular.  The Gable-Kerr team is ideal.  Kerr made an impressive bow on the U.S. screen, and the critics took notice.  Sydney Greenstreet is great as Evan Llewellyn Evans, who thinks America as a blank space between New York and Hollywood where people buy soap!   Producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr. garnered top technical talent for this film and Jack Conway's direction is  first-rate.  Ava Gardner is mesmerizingly beautiful as the nightclub singer, Jean Ogilvie.  At the end of the excellent Luther Davis screenplay, Gable gives out with the kind of denunciation of his brow-beating boss that has been standard cinematurgy for years - the script ribs everything in radio of yore from soap operas to Forest Lawn commercials
1	Very Hilarious. Truely speaking, this is a very hilarious episode. Must see for every one
1	Brilliant!. As a fan of New Order and Joy Division this was on the top of my list. Fast-paced, witty, and shot in documentary like style, 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE is a great movie along side the more traditional narratives like GO, ALL GONE PETE TONG, GROOVE, etc. Winderbottom does a terrific job in satisfying a range of audience and Steve Coogan is terrific. The soundtrack is solid and the produciton value is high. Not to be missed by fans (not ultimate fans) and general movie goers alike
1	Great for kids. I am an elementary music teacher and bought this to show my students. All of the students LOVED it from K-4. The narration makes it easier to understand and keeps the interest.
1	"I have enough stories, I want a life!". 28 Days starring Sandra Bullock, she was courageous to take such a challenging role like this. She plays an alcoholic who is placed in a rehab center for, well you guessed it 28 days. I think Bullock is at her best when she does drama, I love her comdies as well but she expands her talent and growth as an actress in dramatic roles. This film does have funny moments from time to time but it is mainly a hard-hitting drama. The scene where Bullock is in the withdrawal period of her addiction is real and heartbreaking. She is and probably will never be recognized as a gifted performer, she should have been nominated for an award, like the golden globes or something. 28 Days is quirky, spunky, and cute just like Sandy
1	A really well done film. I have to say that I really enjoyed this film.  It is well done and not to mention beautifully shot. It has become one of my favorite films and is much better than most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days.  Most times films are so overhyped that once you sit down to see them you are most often times disappointed.  This film did not receive that much hype and it does not disappoint.  If you love horses, adventure, beautiful scenery and a film about the spirit of man and his horse, then please do see it.  And lets face it (ladies) Viggo Mortensen is just as beautiful as the scenery around him.  He is a very good actor and an underated one at that.  So sit back, pop some corn and enjoy a good adventure.  And admire one of God's most majestic creations...........the horse. (and viggo mortensen!!
1	Incredibly Alluring. Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper make an unlikely pair for a lot of reasons in this film but that does not stop the relationship from working. It sizzles.Audrey is a young Parisian girl, the daughter of a private investigator played by Maurice Chevalier. She is young, beautiful, innocent and plays the cello and is a bit bored. She treats herself to adventure by reading the case files of her father. A good proportion of these case files involve the character played by Gary Cooper. He is a rich American playboy who is always got women. Often, these women are married.Cooper is the single largest source of income for Chevalier and Chevalier cannot help be admire his style. Having gypsy musicians on call to serenade the mark day and night is just one example.When Hepburn learns that an outraged husband plans to kill Cooper, she secretly goes to warn the lovers. In doing so, she falls for Cooper herself and manages to arouse his interest. She knows that any sort of clinging will just turn him off so she tries to play his own strategy against him. She plays the mysterious playgirl with more beaux than she can count. She will not even give him her name.The strategy works. Cooper falls for her in a big way but still she remains silent. In desperation, Cooper hires a private investigator to learn more about her. Naturally, this would be her father.Things do not work out as expected but they do work out well. Hepburn portrays beauty and innocence and not a little female cunning. She is a delight to behold. So are Cooper's fits of uncertainty. Chevalier lends the whole episode a degree of class and dignity. It's a first fate story all around.
1	Awe-Struck. Camille Claudel, a talented and gifted artist, ends up studying under Rodin.  Rodin, because of his name back then, has his way with Camille (as it is implied with many other mistresses as well).  He leaves Camille for his wife. Camille is ruined.  What follows is her gut-wrenching attempt to continue with her work admist the shame she has brought upon herself and her family.  Her ultimate ruin is left to her brother to carry out
1	Fantastic drama of Science Fiction. "Slaughterhouse-Five" (1972 - 104 minutes) is a classic drama of science fiction, directed by George Roy Hill from the script of Stephen Geller that was based on the masterpiece of the North American writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr. The film shows the attempt of an American former-soldier (that fought in the Second World War and that witnessed the bombing of the city of Dresden) to write his experience of the war. Billy Pilgrim (the actor Michael Sacks), the protagonist, is a citizen who travels in time, goes to the Tralfamadore planet where he makes contact with aliens and revisits diverse moments of his own life, in the past, in the present and in the future. The crucial point of his existence is the episode where he was made prisoner during the Second War, when he lived the bombing of the German city in which had died 135 thousand people, the double of deaths of Hiroshima. The narrative is marvellous, fantastic, sarcastic, funny, satirical, ironic, sad, overwhelming and full of sense
1	...When I was very small... This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).
1	A must see. My 12th grade government teacher showed our class this film, and we were all hooked.  If you have ever been in a room of thirty some teenagers, you know that its hard to get their attention and keep them quiet.  So really, if a bunch of teenagers enjoyed this movie, everyone should consider giving it a chance.  It might not be as action packed as some of the movies out today, such as 16 Blocks, but it's gonna keep your attention, so do yourself a favor and atleast rent it, you might find yourself coming back to buy it
1	I wonder. I wonder why the beautiful Lerner-Loewe meoldies and lyrics and the movie itself are not more popular than they are - I'll go home with Bonnie Jean, The heather on the Hill, Almost like being in love. The movie itself is a serious production, meticulous in costumes, design and choreography.This is a fairy tale, almost a charming ghost story, which is so unreal that it only happens in old places like the Scottish highland. Something beautiful that emerges beneath the fog only once in a while.The story is also rich in Scottish culture - bagpipes, kilts, market place and folklore.I also wonder why Van Johnson, with a big build and yet such a nimble tap dancer, did not have more dancing roles in other movies. And Cyd Charisse ballet dancing is simply an eye candy.The melodies are so sweet and chorus so pure that the movie is worth watching over and over again, even if it is only for the songs.
1	SAD, BEAUTIFUL AND HYPNOTIZING. Actually I felt I was in love with this film as soon as I saw the very beginning - the opening credits against the background of Chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music. "Candyman" could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense, but Bernard Rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant, enchanting and spellbinding film out of it. If you're interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won't find it here (you will, but not in quantities you used to). "Candyman" is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what's important, where mood is what matters, where you are given some food for thought. I don't have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film, I can only say it's a great achievement of Bernard Rose as a director besides I guess Tony Todd, Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkeley had their best roles played in this feature.I don't personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre, but "Candyman" is a true gem which wouldn't be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times.By the way if you don't want to spoil your impression of the film, better don't watch "Candyman" parts 2 and 3. They ARE the average tenage urban legend flicks.
1	It's Jimmy Carr - Need more be said?!?. Thanks for keeping a Brit sane in a country full of "My wife says..." jokes.Your wife is fat and ugly and I don't care what she says. Because she's ugly. And fat.....and not my wife
1	This movie is soooooo awesome. Hilary did a great job in the movie. She played Lizzie and Isabella great. She looked great with brown hair. I liked how Lizzie and Isabella sang together. At first I thought she actually had a twin. But hey, This is a great movie. You will love it
1	"I remember how the meaning of words began to change". "V for Vendetta" is an interesting movie that won't allow you to remain indifferent. Love or hate it, I'm pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film, based on a comic written by Alan Moore, adapted to the big screen by the Wachowski Brothers, and directed by James McTeigue.The story begins in England, but not in the England we know. McTeigue's England is eerily similar to the country that Orwell's tells us about in "1984". There is a dictator, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), that was chosen in free elections, but that afterwards decided to become an absolute ruler, exerting power without any kind of restriction. The citizens do nothing, they have relinquished their right to participate and to decide, and are merely sheep being told what to do and what to think. Their freedom is curtailed, but they feel safe.However someone is prepared to shake their certitude, and make them realize that things are not what they seem to be. That person is V (Hugo Weaving), a man that is willing to risk everything in order to turn meek sheep into citizens, and to wreak havoc on the enemies that destroyed his life a long time ago. Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman that V rescues from Sutler's minions, is a privileged spectator of V's plans, and the first person to become a fervent follower. That path, though, is not easy, as Evey's new strenght will be forged in the fires of prison.This is a highly controversial movie that delves upon difficult subjects, for example whether the end validates the means, and the power of words. All the same, "V for Vendetta" makes you think, has great actors, an original cinematography and a hectic pace. From my point of view, this film is simply a must see.Belen Alca
1	U2 Rattle and Hum DVD. I love this movie. I can watch it over and over again and still get the chills. I wish I had been able to see U2 then, when their shows were so full of energy than now when they've really toned it down. The film is fun because you get to see not only performances, but also things behind the scenes: Larry's obsession with Elvis, and interviews where they poke fun at each other.
1	I passed it on to my minister for reading. It defined for me what we Christians are struggling against; secularism and pluarlism.  Christians don't know they are like the frog in the  tepid water that is heating up with secular thinking to the point of crucifying Christ again and we are like the crowd in Jerusalem that was apathetic.  Scientific thinking has created morality and expunged the law of God as the final truth.   RZ states this very clearly but doesn't give us enough push to act on the knowledge.  Hopefully, my minister will push the facts to our congregation so they know why they need to be Delivered From Evil
1	Baseball fans will enjoy this one. 'The Curse of the Grebes' is sort of a tribute to the Red Sox return to World Series glory with cameos by Damon, Timlin and Renteria. Timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by Emily Dickinson with remarkable aplomb. 'Arthur Changes Gears' is also great, he gets a bike he's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he's so worried about getting it dirty that he won't ride it
1	Star Trek At Its Best. Shore Leave is one of the best episodesof the classic series. It uses all thesci fi props but also has a great story,if you don't even care about Star Trekand have to watch one, watch this one.
1	Very Funny. I saw this on tv and loved it, so i had to buy it
1	3 stars for the movie, 1 star for Monica Potter. I could write a bunch of stuff here trying to convince you that I'm smarter than you but that's pretty much a waste of my time and yours. I like this movie in spite of a few flaws and glitches, to me the overall product is often more important than the parts it's comprised of. The story line has interesting twists, it has actors in it I like. So I give the movie itself three stars and toss in another star just because I get to watch Morgan Freeman act and Monica Potter be cute as hell (I just REALLY REALLY wish she could act but cute will do). Not a bad way to spend an hour or two
1	One of the Best Bibically-Based Films. This is one of the very best Bibically-based films ever, and it was also on of the best of the early "sequels."  Taking up the story precisely where The Robe left off, it is an even more exciting tale of the Greek slave, Demetrius, and his quest to protect the robe Jesus wore at His crucifixion.  A must for the Easter season, or for any time one needs reaffirmation of faith.
1	Engrossing from the first 30 seconds. Clooney is a marvel.  This story was so captivating that I sat on the edge of my seat straining to hear all the dialogue.  Althought the scene shifts make it difficult to track at first, I was drawn in and held spellbound
1	Feeling sorry for yourself?. Ever feel like life is getting you down? This is the movie that will make you realize that you have NOTHING to complain about.Feeling sorry for yourself? Watch "My Left Foot" You may see your troubles are not so bad after all.Worth getting the Special Edition for all the extra stuff
1	awesome chicks. If you are a Dixie Chicks fan you will find no better musical experience.The music,vocals,fans and emotions are unbeatable.Also I couldnt help but notice every female in the crowd were gorgeous
1	One of my Favorite movies!. No, its not classy.  No one uses sharp, flashy camera moves to wow the viewer.  The plot line is neither deep nor inriching for the soul.  Still, Sgt. Bilko is an incredibly funny movie that shows Steve Martin at his height of comedy.  The story, which involves Steve Martin as a sargeant who uses his motor pool as a small casino for the soldiers on the base behind his superior's back, is outrageously funny and sends that viewer from beginning to end without becoming belabored.  Bottom line: This is a great movie that cane be enjoyed by anyone
1	Enlightening.... What I loved about this movie is that Jeffrey Wright showed the emotional and sensitive side of Basquiat, as well as his creative side. It showed his struggles with his personal life as it overcame his professional. The characters were so real...so human and true to life in that time. I really enjoyed this movie. It pulled me into his life....only I wish I knew more...
1	I love this movie!!!. I finally bought this movie! Everytime it would air on TCM my 15 yr old daughter and I watched. It's not a scary movie, rather fascinating to see actual freaks of nature, not hollywood actors dressed in prosthetics and makeup. Prince Randian rocks. No arms or legs yet he rolls his own cigarettes, strikes a match, lights up and smokes. WOW! Have you ever seen a real pinhead! Not the freak with pins sticking out of his face, but a real pinhead. This movie has 3.
1	Wonderful Mother-Daughter movie to watch. This movie was refreshing and gave great values on family traditions, love, self-esteem and friendship! And that growing-up has its difficulties, but with the love and support of those who love us, things can turn out to be very different than what we expect or what is expected of us. My daughter and I loved the movie and we bonded and it was a catalyst for all sorts of conversation. I recommend it!
1	BS tells it all. I have watched most of the BS series and this is one that shows what is happening to many of our american organizations. Religious control
1	Vampiers but different. this movie is a must too see., its not made for the kids but its a great movie for the adults, my advice if you dont have it get it add it too you collection. a great movie and a twist of a movie. and it even has David Bowie in it guys. go and get this movie a move to buy. tk
1	This Has Been...a Love Story. I finally made my first purchase from Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads just to try the service and am happy to report a solid customer experience. For $1.99, I purchased and downloaded one of my favorite episodes of "The Twilight Zone", and it took about twenty minutes to download through a broadband connection. I don't think it's the most ideal way to see full-length motion pictures, but for a 26-minute classic TV program, I think my 17" LCD monitor makes for a suitable viewing experience, and the video quality of the downloaded file is clean.Aired on September 15, 1961 as the show's third season opener, the episode is a Cold War fantasy appropriately called "Two" about the last two survivors on earth, a man and a woman, after an apocalyptic world war in 2109. Written and directed by TV veteran Montgomery Pittman, the simple plot revolves around the complicating fact that he is an American infantryman and she is an invading Russian soldier. Like two feral animals, they glare at each other among the debris of a deserted town destroyed by the war. He even knocks her out her after she aggressively throws pots and pans at him. The reality of their solitary existence, however, gradually dawns on them, especially after they see an evening dress in a shop window inspiring her to speak her only word of dialogue - "Prekrassnyi" - the Russian word for "lovely".What really makes this episode memorable is the unlikely casting. Two years before she twitched her nose on "Bewitched", a brunette Elizabeth Montgomery, looking appropriately ravaged and sporting a deadly ray gun, plays the untrusting Russian soldier with surprising fierceness and vulnerability. The American is played by perennial tough-guy Charles Bronson, fresh from "The Magnificent Seven". Even though he has to spout some inane philosophical lines to describe the futility of war, he leavens his natural sullenness with a determined romanticism. They make an odd couple, but it works splendidly. I also learned that canned fried chicken will become a staple in the 22nd century. Narrated by Rod Serling in his inimitably halting manner, the show ends with my favorite line in his signature postscript: "This has been...a love story." This is classic TV
1	Seasonal Classic. I'm an avid movie maniac.  I have certain films that I can only watch at certain times of the year, and do, every year.  Other Peoples Money, starts off my fall movie viewing, after Halloween of course.  I love the new England Autumn charm of this film.  The story is good, dialogue clever and the chemistry between Miller and DeVito is scary.  An unlikely romanic couple if ever there was.  A Classic in my book
1	If you love her, let her go... Sofia Coppola takes on conformity in a black comedy about a house of five young girls who are just trying to reach out and grow up in the world, if their parents would allow them. It is told through the watching, voyeuristic eyes of young boys who obsess over the girls mentally, emotionally, sexually, and even intellectually.It was pretty good, I enjoyed it.  There really isn't much I feel there is to say about it, as it is a pretty self-contained little movie.  Coppola satirizes the clean warmth of suburbia without the self-indulgence of most artists dealing with conformity.  I'm surprised by the cover descriptions and synopses that talk about this film as if it's a mystery; it's about as mysterious as what drives Charles Kane.  However the "haunting lyricism" and "dark humor" aspects are pretty correct.It's a pretty good film.--PolarisDi
1	Possible inspiration for "Star Wars" Death Star attack?. As another reviewer so astutely observed, the climactic bombing run through a fjord at a specific target evokes the Jedi attack on the Death Star at the conclusion of "Star Wars." While George Lucas has acknowledged Kurasawa's "Hidden Fortress" as a primary influence on "Star Wars," I wonder if he had "633 Squadron" in the back of his mind when designing the end run on the Death Star? Something to ponder.The other reviewers have said some wonderful things about the excellent and authentic aerial combat footage, and the footage of the Mosquito fighters themselves, so I will only add my praise to theirs.The only quibbles I have with the movie are the very fake miniature plane models used in the climactic bombing run, Cliff Robertson's lack of a British accent (he is playing an RAF captain...the only flaw in an otherwise marvelous performance),   and the trite, standard romance that always seems a part of most war movies.Overall, worth owning and watching several times.
1	Seeing is Believing. I saw this video onboard the sailboat Le Ponant just prior to entering the Panama Canal. The video was incredible and allowed each of us to better understand the magnitude and complexity of the project. David McCullough does a fantastic job of commentary
1	still burning at the end. Although Lenny was near the end when this performance was filmed, he still puts on a riveting show. He does go on about the legal system a lot but what he says makes so much sense. You almost wish he could have used something like this in some of his courtroom defenses. He always said the prosecutors would do a "bad" Lenny Bruce in court! For people who assume he was constantly harrased and busted for his foul language, get a hold of this film and see how brilliant he was.
1	a little too loving?. This is a well made and well acted movie.  If you love baseball and tribute movies, you'll be in seventh heaven.  If you don't already love baseball, though, you may get a trifle bored by how slowly this loving tribute lingers over its subject, like a lover caressing the object of his desire.  Family Movie?  My five year-old daughter lasted about fifteen minutes; my nine-year-old daughter made it almost a half an hour before she retired to the den to watch reruns on the Disney channel.
1	My DVD Video. The DVD that I purchased was in excellent conditiona and the price was very reasonable
1	Enjoyable, even if it isn't your usual fare... As an American watching a translation, it's sometimes difficult to determine a film-maker's intent. Ever since "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," we in the West have had to re-evaluate martial arts cinema--it's not always about revenge. Sometimes, it seems pretty inexplicable. You know-- different culture, different philosophy, etc. (That's what I'm told, anyway. Since I don't speak Chinese, I couldn't exactly say WHAT gets lost in translation.)Regardless of culture or genre, the big question always has to be: did you like the movie?Well, yes, I liked it. I don't know if I get all of it, but I liked it. The action sequences and special effects are soundly executed without taking over the film. The actors are enjoyable to watch, and I actually got the jokes (there were many). At the end of the movie, I felt like I'd watched a story, and not just fluff.  There was a theme and hidden plot behind all those flying people with swords. You gotta like that.
1	Great Nostalgia Trip!!. I was 7 when I watched these shows.  Great memories.  And Soupy Sales is an added bonus!!  Just amazing how things have changed...Not sure if this set will appeal to the younger crowd, but for us aging baby boomers it's a fun trip
1	As relevant today as ever. What is at stake here is the kind of government that we, people, want to give ourselves. It's been the same choice since the end of the Roman Republic. Here we have two factions, both are excellent demagogues, both play on the mobs appetites and weaknesses. The heart of the film (or play) is the speeches of Brutus (the Conservative), and of Antony (the Liberal). The interesting thing for the viewer is that we are at the same time part of the mob, who listens intently while at the side of Caesar's corpse, and have the extraordinary advantage of witnessing from closer range the hidden expressions in Antony's face: his true thoughts and intentions. So we are able to distinguish two facts about both orators that will help us balance our vote on one or the other candidates. And these 2 things are: First, Brutus is honest towards his party and to the people. You may agree or disagree -actually, the mob agrees with him concerning the necessary death of the ambitious Caesar-; but he is an honest man, and so Antony, in a side, admits that he is honest. The second thing we discover is that Antony is a deceiver, a deceiver towards Brutus by not fulfilling his word of honor and arousing the populace against Brutus; and a demagogue towards the mob.It always ends the same way: the demagogues wins the day. Sounds familiar? I remember when years ago in Per the foreign candidate, Fujimori won the election against Vargas Llosa, the famous writer. Fujimori stole all the money he laid his eyes on, and when he was found out he left for Japan and solicited -and obtained- assylum (thanks to his Japannese origin).It is true that in this film both parties are corrupt, and only look after their own greedy interests. But some times an honorable man shows up, and begs, cries out for a chance. This is the story of Brutus: the honorable man of all times."Not that I loved Caesar lessbut that I loved Rome more.""Had you rather Caesar were living,and die as slaves?""Who is here so vile that will not love his country?If any, speak, for him have I offended."The only perfect Kingdom is the one our Lord will bring in His second coming. Amen.The 4 stars are because in the second part of the film the interest decreases notably.
1	What a great movie!. How many movies can you really enjoy with the young people in your life?  This is one of the few.  I watched this with great reluctance, and found myself absolutely loving it!  Believe me, you really won't be nauseated! You will laugh
1	Tremendous!!. "Put a lot of sex in it; that's always nice," Lorenzo (protagonist of this film) is advised about his novel-in-progress. "Sex and Lucia," which contains stories within stories within stories, unpacks this claim, showing that sex is not always "nice," but that like narrative it can be liberating and transformative.Tragedy and betrayal lie at this film's heart, but because its story bends and twists around as it follows Lorenzo's false starts and revelations as a writer (it has, as it explains, a hole at the center which the audience, like the characters, can fall through) it also offers a way out -- a way to distinguish voyeurism and pornography from love and art, a way to stay faithful to a vision of human trust and imagination.Brilliantly accomplished, "Sex and Lucia" displays the loveliness and ample talent of its stars, especially the beautiful Paz Vega (as Lucia) and Tristan Ulloa (as Lorenzo). A tremdous film
1	The Wind in the Willows. The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, was originally a series of bedtime stories for Grahame's son.  It is still commonly considered to be a children's book, but it is too difficult for young children to read themselves, and many older children will no longer appreciate the simple themes it covers.  I imagine that its chief appeal is to adults, although children might enjoy having some parts of the book read to them.The characters - Mole, Rat, Badger, and Toad - are wonderful creations.  Mole, Rat, and Badger are conspicuously brave and loyal creatures.  They love the comforts of home and hearth, yet they constantly set off on one rescue mission or another without a thought to their own safety.  Toad, on the other hand, is a boastful nitwit, and it is amusing to the reader to see him brought down to size again and again.In reading this book, you get the idea that Grahame had thought for a long time about what it is like to be an animal.  He understands how their energy ebbs and wanes with the seasons, and he writes that it is a great breach of animal courtesy to ask a favor during the winter, when everyone wants to stay inside and doze during most of the day.  In summer, though, the animals are often abroad throughout the night, and they may see the sky grow bright again before they return home.  Grahame also has wonderful intuition about animal senses:"We others, who have long lost the more subtle of the physical senses, have not proper terms to express an animal's intercommunications with his surroundings, living or otherwise, and have only the word `smell,' for instance, to include the whole range of delicate thrills which murmur in the nose of the animal night and day, summoning, warning, inciting, repelling.  It was one of these mysterious fairy calls from out the void that suddenly reached Mole in the darkness, making him tingle through and through with its very familiar appeal, even while as yet he could not clearly remember what it was."What calls out to Mole in the darkness is his home, and a great deal of this book is an enumeration of the pleasures of home: the snugness and familiarity, the comfort of a well-used chair in front of the fire, and the simple pleasures of the table.  Highly recommended
1	James Stewart Preserves Our Freedoms with Conviction. This is a very good film from director Anthony Mann starring James Stewart and June Allyson. The film focuses on the operations of post-war America's modern Airforce and the lives of the men and women who lived it. It is beautifully photographed by William Daniels and Tom Tutwiler. We slept much sounder at night knowing the Strategic Air Command was above us protecting our freedoms around the clock. James Stewart's performance is one of honor and conviction
1	Holy. Like the review I just read, Tarkovskies' ANDRE RUBLEV is the movie that I keep coming back to over the years. It is my favorite film and has been until something as special comes along.More than any filmmaker in any country, in any language, this movie has imparted and impressed it's viewpoint into my perception. I have incorporated it into my vision. I resonate with it... It plays me like a bell.It is not an entertainment really though much of it is entertaining.  This film transcends both entertainment and mere artistic success -  the images and themes are so spiritually charged and archetypically strong that one may have the sense while watching it, that he or she is remembering half forgotten dreams.Like the person whose review I just read, I often pause in simple wonder after a chapter just to let it ring.The film chronicles the life and spiritual development of Russian artist, Icon painterAndre Rublev.  The epic unfolds in 6 chapters the last of which introduces another artist, a young Church bell maker. The chapter reveals aspects and components of the creative process both literally and in allegory ...one senses that the filmmaker Tarkovsy and the young bell-maker may have a great deal in common and that he may have written himself into this section....this last chapter "Spring" is shot through with a narrative vitality, an energetic quality to the expression that is simply colossal -  there is a joy in the unfolding and discovery of this bell-makers  own creative powers...all of which is witnessed by the aging jaded Andre Rublev who is, as a witness, transformed by what he sees, as will be anyone who has eyes to see and apprehend the naked wonder of this last chapter.Andre Tarkovsky made this film in what used to be the USSR  during a period of rigid and scrutinizing censorship. He used the artistic restraints and the hoops he had to jump through to a brilliant advantage carefully codifying individual artistic and spiritual themes into the chapters of this epic.  The constraints seem to have served to discipline and streamline the narrative...the result is golden ...more truth per foot of film than any I can compare it to.I saw it first on video in college in a russian art history class, later bought the dvd, and more recently attended a screening at Disney Studios that  colleague was given the invite to but couldn't make.  I brought someone who just didn't get it.Tarkovsy  is not for everyone though you should give yourself the benefit of the doubt because, if he IS for you, you may very well be changed and touched  and rewarded again and again by this truly timeless gem
1	There is nothing wrong with the picture quality !. After reading other reviews that state poor quality "transfer" I will disagree. The video quality on the DVD and VHS is the same as the original broadcast. This teleplay was originally recorded on videotape not film. Early videotape recordings do not have near the quality of film or todays video recordings.I do prefer the VHS version over the DVD as the VHS sound is analog. Since this is a musical I especially do not want the sound ruined by converting it to digital, I want to hear all of the great soundtrack as originally recorded.
1	The Effects of Ignorance. Errol Morris, via The Fog of War, proved that he is one of the most talented documentary filmmakers of our day. This film directly proceeded the McNamera classic but much of his skill at the genre is on display. The interplay of music and camera, and the way in which he captures onscreen the unsuspecting and pathetic Fred Leuchter is artful-this is true even the close-ups of coffee pots and electrical currents emanating from his head during the opening.That viewers feel sympathy for this confused, broken man who is devoid of social skills and social comprehension is an unintended consequence of the vehemence in which the forces of political correctness attacked him. He definitely had no idea as to the way he would be vilified simply by appearing at the Zundel trial. Leuchter, an engineer in deed only, with no scientific academic background whatsoever, conducted a middle school like science experiment at Birchenau and believed, based on some shoddy chemical analysis, that no cyanide gas was used there. The result was that his life was ruined.Personally, as a life long learner who has never been, and will never be, a historical revisionist, the destruction of Fred Leuchter is appalling. I completely believe and know that the holocaust occurred, but am aghast that certain "activists" think they have the right to destroy of the lives of those who disagree with them. Why didn't these brave activists respond to his arguments rather than conduct a campaign of hate? His positions are juvenile. Leuchter knew nothing about chemical tests, history, or society in general. He was an easy mark, but their emotionalizing the issue had the reverse effect. It made people think they had no answers to his arguments. It legitimizes revisionism. By squashing this non-entity they made him a martyr. What they should have done was publish vigorous refutations, instead they made Leuchter appear a champion of free inquiry; which, by the way, he is in comparison to shrieking critics and the Canadian government. This is the way in which political correctness and reckless emotion have damaged our intellects and degraded our culture. Bullying, shaming, and forcing guilt upon others is exactly how you vile personas like Ernst Zundel were created in the first place. Zundel is a reaction to such attempts.
1	Takes me back to my childhood. I love this movie.  And I don't have anything bad to say about it.  But if you get the DVD be prepared because the movie and the audio tracks do not match.  So you hear an actor speak before their mouths move.  This drove me crazy but I still enjoyed the movie
1	Clever, Creative and Funny!. Lilly Tomlin is hysterical in this movie. She makes this movie. It' fun, and your rooting for the women all the way. One specific part is not for the kids. My kids were bored with it. But I enjoyed it from the release date and it's still entertaining
1	A Real Treasure!. I ordered this DVD when it first came out and I've been enjoying it ever since. All the performances are enjoyable- some more than others, but they are all wonderful nonetheless. Some of my pesonal favorites include:Patti Lupone bringing down the house along with Mandy Patinkin and Bob Gunton doing the song "A New Argentina" from Evita. This is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this DVD.Anegela Lansbury providing a hilarious performance in "The worst Pies in London" from Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet StreetCarol Channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational "Before the Parade Passes By" from Hello, Dolly!Yul Brynner performing "Shall We Dance?" with his co-star (not sure of her name). This performance is priceless and so is that dress!John Raitt's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song-"Hey There" from The Pajama GamePaul Lynde delivers a ton of laughs in "Kids" from Bye Bye BirdieJoel Grey and cast perform the spectacle that is Cabaret in the song "Willkommen". This song never gets out of your head!Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera- two of Broadway's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from Chicago: "All That Jazz" and "Nowadays". Bob Fosse's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment.Jerry Orbach. His death was a tragic loss to the theater. That's why these DVD's are so remarkable. This is another top performance- the song "Lullaby of Broadway" from 42nd Street. It was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to NYC to see my very first broadway show- 42nd Street.Andrea McArdle and the orphans perform "Tomorrow" and "You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile" from Annie. This is just superb. There's absolutely no flaws.Betty Buckley and cast perform two songs from Cats-"Jellicle Songs" and the classic "Memory". It is stunning to watch.Any performance with Patti LuPone in it is a gem in itself. This one- "Buenos Aires" from Evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of Eva Peron.Bonnie Franklin and cast are hilarious in the song"Applause" from the show Applause. The whole theme to the song is 100% true and kind of "hits home" for every actor. Plus, it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you're a big fan of musicals.All in all, this DVD is totally worth buying! And after you're through with this one and have memorized all the songs, check out Broadway's Lost Treasures II. I have yet to receive III, but I am looking forward to it!
1	Holly Hunter great actress, beatifull bodie. HiNice and interesting drama , but the best part is Holly Hunter naked, long scene, a rare appearance for this actress.So if you are her fan or just a collector like me this movie is for you.RegardsAv
1	A Mystery Solved . . . Vampire-enthusiasts who have read Strieber's novel, had a bit of a surprise when they saw Scott's "The Hunger." There were several liberties taken with the film. Still, on many occasions, adaptation for screen often includes sacrifices: especially for time and budget. We accept this. But . . . there was always something a little "off" here . . .Let's start from the beginning. This film is exquisitely shot. The framing is simple and beautiful. In fact, the composition is almost breath-taking (still frames could appear as individual photographs suitable for display). Likewise, the acting is beyond reproach. Pitch-perfect. The costumes . . . unforgettable (the glasses alone)! The soundtrack is lush . . . in fact, when I first rented the film in middle-school I was inspired to explore classical music. Today, I have an extensive collection . . . and "Bach: Cello Suites 1-6" remains my favorite (thank you, Mr. Scott for such a wonderful gift).The tale is both sensual and heart-breaking. **SPOILER (STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FILM)**: Interestingly, Susan Sarandon describes the film as a metaphor for addiction. In the director's commentary she explains that her character would rather commit suicide than to live with an addiction to blood . . . with an addiction to death . . . to be a conduit of death. Does that comment sound odd considering how the film concludes?? Here is what happened . . .The film was intended to end with the powerful death of Dr. Sarah Roberts. It was to be a story of sacrifice. BUT, as Scott and Sarandon reveal, "the powers that be" (their words) (meaning, the studio executives) demanded the tag at the end. You see, the studio was hoping for a sequel (and, obviously more money). So, the entire message of the film was destroyed . . . not to mention the attention to continuity was left in ruins. The bitterness in this commentary is justified. By insisting on a nonsensical ending ("So, how did Miriam's lovers decompose if she is still alive?!"), the film did not achieve the box-office success predicted . . . and the sequel was shelved.So, why grant this film five stars? No matter what . . . this film is nearly as engrossing as the first time I saw it. It is, in my opinion, one of the most inventive, captivating vampire films ever made. And seeing Peter Murphy made me feel thirteen all over again . . . I think I'll break out some Bauhaus  . . . right . . . now.Suggested Reading: Hanson, Ellis. "Vampires Who Bite." Out Takes Essays on Queer Theory and Film. Ed. Ellis Hanson. Durham: Duke UP, 1999. 183-222.This essay explores lesbian vampirism in film history with particular attention to "Dracula's Daughter," "Vampyres," and "The Hunger."
1	A WINNING ELECTION. Rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence, teenage angst, sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from Alexander Payne.  Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range.  Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality.  In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty.  One of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election.  Reese prays to an unfamiliar God and beseeches him to let her win so she "can carry out his divine plan."  Campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the Catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to, while goofy Klein shows the most depth by thanking God for all of his blessings (especially his large penis) and telling God he knows the best candidate will win.ELECTION is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind.  Enjoy
1	Shakespeare Would Be Proud. When it comes to film adaptations, most films fail in some way.  To think that a Japanese film director could transform one of the greatest plays written in the English language and mke it his own, is quite tremendous. To think that he could use Japanese Noh theater images to enhance the adpatation is a stroke of genius.  Mifune is one of the greatest actors to play Macbeth, and dare say maybe the best.  Akira Kurosawa directed a masterpiece and proves why he is at the top of the pantheon of great world directors.And, of course, The Criterion Collection folk out do themselves, again.  Thank goodness for them, because of it wasn't for them, we all would be missing out on great films.
1	Woody's First Great Movie. Allen's talent grew in leaps and bounds in the late 60's and early 70's.  Sleeper was only his fifth directorial effort and is still considered one of his best. Personally, my favorite "pure" comedy of Allen's entire career.  In Sleeper, he best combines stand-up material with physical comedy to make hilarious and biting social satire. Only Allen would compliment, albeit sardonically, the Nazi's for their single positive contribution to society: the Volkswagon Bug. The Third Reich may not have lasted longer than fifteen years but that's a great little car. Along the way, he lampoons everything from repressive Orwellian societies to sex toys.  A great starting point for newcomers to Woody Allen films
1	As scary as it was so many years ago. this movie is a great example of movie making at its finest. The eerie atmosphere makes dialogue unecessary and the creepy black and white tones complement this as well. Note: many versions of this movie are available, many which include 20 minutes of more film. The alpha film versions states it ontains 85 or so minutes but the case claims only 64.
1	Not sissy stuff: important gay avant garde. The gay condition, this is the glory and the gutter, the heavenly and the hellish,a juxtaposition of the rich interior of gay desire and the shoddy conditions of "actual" gay existence. Look, young man, and be afraid. Be very afraid
1	I cannot not lie about this movie: It rocked!. This is a majestic, genre-defying delve into three disparate (and desperate) women. Whoopi's performance is at least as strong as her  roles in Jumpin' Jack Flash, Fatal Beauty and Burglar. And if you liked those films, I hope you're not raising any small children or corporate management of any type.Anyway, Drew Barrymore is thoroughly convincing as a trashy, loose and unintelligent woman. It didn't even feel like she was acting to me.And Parker Posey looked a little differently than I remembered her, but she was good as the sick girl who we all feel sorry for because she came from an abusive home ... maybe if she tried listening once in a while it wouldn't have been so bad.
1	what a shock!. Michael Caine gives a great performance in this movie as he was passed over for a promotion. He plays by the rules only to get trampled by those less deserving of said promotion. Then he takes matters into his own hands and makes power moves that gets him his much deserved promotion by any means necessary
1	Straight talking Frankie with demure Kim. A great movie. I liked this movie because I like the way Sinatra talks and sings. He is a natural actor always ready with a 'tough-guy' quip delivered with perfect pace and vocal variety. Kim Novak for me is a fabulous actress. Not only is she beautiful but she plays the part of a shy and hesitant starlet perfectly. The songs and the story are great both of which I have transfered to my i-pod to listen to over and over again.
1	One of those movies that should never be re-made. Well, finally this is on DVD.  Like "Miracle on 34th St.", "Christmas Carol", etc., this movie has one definitive version, and should never have been touched again.  Wallace Beery is Long John Silver, for anyone else to play his part should condemn them to the lower reaches where they have to watch Green Acres re-runs for eternity, the very idea makes me physically ill.  Jackie Cooper's role here is absolutely brilliant, upon my soul!  And the movie itself is really quite well done, very exciting and interesting, well acted in all the parts.  But matey, when it comes to parrots perching on shoulders, the digital Wallace Beery will live forever.  An essential movie, probably top 100 all time
1	Super DI, Aye, aye. Here's a message to Hollywood.  There are perhaps a million former Marines out there that will buy The D.I. on DVD as soon as its released.I saw The DI as a 12 year old on television in 1960.  I was petrified by the movie and never thought I'd join the Marines because of it.  Well, in 67 I did join and went through bootcamp in San Diego, almost within sight of my house.I think Full Metal Jacket is more realistic but doesn't deliver the positive message served up in The DI.  Webb does a magnificent job depicting the stoic drill instructor.  The intensity of the training in bookcamp, the concern for details (as depicted in the breaking down and reassembly of an M1) that make up a recruits world are dead on.The DI is a classic.  Like other reviewers before me I find it puzzling that this film hasn't made the transition to DVD when so much garbage has.  But then Hollywood and the people that populate show biz haven't a clue about being a Marine.  Its been almost 40 years and I still remember the names of my drill instructors.  Sgt. Alley where are you?Semper Fi
1	A Christmas Classic. For every season, there is a classic movie.  In our house, "A Christmas Story" tops the list when Christmas rolls around.  Without a doubt this movie is a classic!  Ralphie and his quest for the Red Ryder BB gun -- I do love this movie.
1	Nice and awesome. I absolutely love Atlantis. From Ronon Dex, to Sheppard, and to all the faces. I'd cry if Atlantis was cancelled. Seriously though, Steve should have never have died, he should also have been put in command of SG1. Can you imagine that..."Why Steve, welcome to Earth...you're welcome to live out your life, if you only feed in self defense on enemies...'kay? Oh, you're also in charge of Sg1. :P" But seriously, the Wraith make this show so awesome. From Steve to Bob to Edward, to Gordon and Alexander, to Michael and Eric (by far James's best performance yet).The Wraith make this show what it is. But one thing??? Why don't we have Before I Sleep? Seriously, you have no idea how irked I am at that, since I began watching in S.2.12.Anyways, I think Atlantis totally pwns SG1
1	Halloween fans love them all!. Sure it is no where near being as good as the original, but as a fan of the Halloween's I love them all including this somewhat cheesy attempt to keep the story going.  If you are going to believe that a man can be shot and blown up and all that other stuff and can still live on then you cannot complain about this flick.  Plus it has great comedic one liners that will make you laugh.  My opinion is that is still better than half the crap they make nowadays
1	PESCI'S PHILOSOPHY. WITH HONORS is a thoughtful and well done little "slice of life" with a moral we've all heard before:  do what makes you happy and take time to live your life.  Director Alex Keshishian and screenwriter William Mastrosimone, however, don't knock you over the head with its theme and/or morals.  There are some scenes where you're expecting the probable to happen and they don't:  e.g., after Simon cooks Gorky, the rooster, you expect his master to be furious---when Simon finally meets up with the son he abandoned, you expect some kind of tearful reunion----and you certainly think Monty is going to graduate with honors.  The end results of these scenes, however, avoid the usual cliche.  Joe Pesci is delightfully understated in his role, and although he never really becomes coochy coo loveable, you understand his pains and shortcomings; Brendan Fraser starts out pretty snooty and insufferable but as he matures in his relationship with both Pesci and Moira Kelly (who is delightful as Courtney), Fraser becomes a more sympathetic character; Patrick Dempsey adds some lightweight humor as Gorky's master, and Josh Hamilton eschews the usual pain in the butt role with a believable and touching change of heart.The movie is definitely manipulative, but its heart is in the right place and its cast takes it seriously, so it ends up being a charming little film with a strong reaffirmation of the human spirit
1	Good,but not better than the original. This was a good sequel,but not better than the first one.He plays Kurts brother and fights Tong Po.Van Damne is way better though
1	I LIKED this movie!!!!. I don't know WHY this movie is getting so poo pooed, I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan but I found this movie to be cute, funny & sweet!It's a cartoon for God's sake!I thought the animation was great and I adore Whitey! Sue me but I for one LIKED THIS MOVIE! Rasberries to those who OVER analized and critisized it
1	Light hearted. A light and breezy production of Shakespeare's most renown light and breezy play. The cast and director make this look fun and easy, which is of course a sure sign of just how much hard work they must have put it into it. The sets, costumes, locations and music are terrific. Kline steals the show. People unfamiliar with Shakespeare may find the dialogue difficult at first, my advice ignore it, sit back, enjoy the show and it will magically work it's charm
1	I need to stop laughing, it hurts too much!. This movie is downright hilarious the whole way through. In this story, Ralphie, who is 9 years old, must convince his parents and teacher what the perfect gift for christmas is. At first, he hesitates, and when he asks, its always the same answer: "Oh, no. you'll shoot you're eye out!" Raphie stops at nothing to get what he wants. He would not even listen to the teacher when she gave him a C on his "what i want for christmas" paper and told him it's a bad idea. He didnt even listen to who he thought was the real santa.The funniest scenes in this movie are :1. when ralphie and his friends get chased by 2 bullies2. when his father gets a lamp shaped like a leg and ralphie's mother "accidentally" breaks it,3. when the dogs next door take the dinner turkey4. when raphie find out what the little orphan annie code was only a commercial for ovaltine5. when ralphie gets soap put in his mouth when he says the F-dash-dash-dash word(it is censored by fudge)6. when santa pushes him down the slide of doom.My whole family always said, "it isnt Christmas without watching this movie". If you're dying for christmas to come, why not spend time watching this on tv? You'll never miss it, it comes on all day both on christmas and christmas eve
1	beautiful movie. mccabe & mrs. miller is often talked about as one in a list of director robert altman's seventies films that takes on a cinematic genre (namely the western) and subverts it to the point of making it seem like an attack on its cinematic precedents. the traditional western's gung-ho heroism is nowhere in evidence and, it seems, mccabe is a mere parody of a hero that director invites the audience to laugh at.if this was the case, than mccabe and mrs. miller would, at best, be looked upon as a satirical look-back at cinematic tastes of the fifties. a self-congratulatory "how far we've come..." negation of the western's romance in favour of a neo-realist version of the west populated with a cast of ambiguous charaters that are anything but heroic. if altman's "the long goodbye" transported the hopelessly out-of-date phillip marlowe into the californian seventies than "mccabe and mrs. miller" inverts this and transposes the typically indecisive modern man(californian or otherwise) into the context of the mythical west.but this is to do both "mccabe and mrs. miller" and it's western precedents a disservice. the film works best not as a suberversion of a genre, which in the end is just satire, but as a subervsion or, more correctly, deconstruction of myth (regardless of individual and singular genre) which is much grander. if elements of subverting the western seem implicit in this than it is true to the point of having pre-conceived notions of the archetypal western hero and that would be ignoring the moral complexities of john wayne's character in "the searchers" or william holden in "the wild bunch", to name a couple.at the outset, we are presented with the figure of mccabe, newly entered into presbyterian church society. brash, intent on playing cards and buying rounds, the impression of bravura western confidence we have is solidified by the circulating rumour of his killing a man in days gone by. skip to the film's end and our initial impressions have been justified. the myth has been confirmed and has flourished and is ready to continue.it is in the movie's middle acts where the myth is subverted. warren beatty is exceptional as the indecisive businessman whose assertiveness is whittled away by the scene. not in any western since "johnny guitar" has a female taken such an authoritive role as julie christy here. she is decidedly the dominant partner, in both their business and their relationship. decidedly, this is subversion but it is the film's focus of the business and the relationships which ultimately makes it more. when it comes to the point where another character asserts that mccabe has never killed a man, the audience is in accord.yet, the myth comes to be. it is all the stronger and more romantic for its being rooted in the work-a-day realities. in this, it is as much a comment on art as it is on the western and has little to do with ultra-realism. there is myth of its own in the making of the myth and altman and vilmos zsigmond's stunning cinematography realize this beautifully here. "mccabe & mrs. miller" is one of the great films of the seventies and a personal favorite
1	Memphis Belle. One of my favorite movies, particularly if you're a WWII buff.  I watch it at least once a year
