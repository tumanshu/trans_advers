0	A Simple Mind. I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation.
0	Typical liberal rhetoric. I first read passages from this book in college.  I can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds.  Professor Zinn is a far left author.  He uses the usual lines: America generally bad, communism generally good.  Obviously Mr. Zinn has the right to write whatever he wants, and his writing style is very convincing.  However, if the reader investigates the facts, many holes become visible in his theories.  Those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints.  A good example is "Intellectual Morons : How Ideology Makes Smart People Fall for Stupid Ideas by Daniel J. Flynn" which gives the reader a good profile of Mr. Zinn.
0	wouldn't read it again. I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was.  All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore
0	Half Assed. This books was way too overhyped.  Upon purchasing it I was greatly dissappointed.  It does give an introductory crash course in some guitar theory, but a lot of its information is half assed.  The way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that I would actually consider as being wrong.  A lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid. Who cares how to play &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in a bunch of different ways, but I suppose that might get you started at finding chords in more than one place on the fretboard.  Nevertheless, this book is boring and incomplete. Buy something else
0	OJ Should Hire Posner. This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing "scientific" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it , for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations.
0	lots of fill...little thrill. As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.
0	Half of the book is blank reserved for notes!. Pages 38 to 97 -- half the book -- is just blank space for notes, which you could just as well write in a 10-cent, 70-page notebook spiral. The beginning of the book is mostly made up of pages with simple checklists and address forms, with some bulletted questions here and there
0	Technically excellent, but artistically disappointing. I was actually fairly disappointed by this book, though it does merit very high marks on the technical issues, i.e. the reproductions are of high quality, and the photographer knew his tools. It's just that I didn't care  for the choice of images.  Most of the images are very contrasty, moving  quickly between almost oily highlights and deep shadows.  The poses, while  visually interesting, were very artificial and to me, unappealing.  I guess  the photographer was going for presenting the structure of the body and  different kinds of lines you could generate with it.  In that regard, he  did a good job, but it was not a goal that appealed to me.  And one final  FYI, the book is black and white -- no value judgement on that, just  information that I didn't see elsewhere on this page
0	The Highest Bottom Drunk Ever. If you are at the top of your profession, totally successful, financially secure, surrounded by hot babes, driving a Porsche, AND you have a desire to stop drinking, this is your book.  Wait, on second thought, that is the whole book.  You can read this review or blow $12 and read the longer version.  Your choice
0	Huge disappointment. After reading "Men Who Can't Love" (which, by the way, is brilliant!), I was excited to pick up another piece by these authors.  Unfortunately I was more than disappointed.  I should have seen a red flag when I saw the title, so I have no one to blame but myself.  Any woman who decides to "like herself" just so that a man can like her is sadly mistaken (you like yourself for yourself, not anybody else!).  Generalizations such as "a balding man is a better catch than a hottie" are... simply put, ignorant.  Theory that a lengthy first phone conversation indicates problems in the relationship going forward is ridiculous.  Half way through the book, I came to conclusion that it was written for teenagers - a couple of valid points surrounded by a whole lot of common sense rambling.  Women who want to improve their self-esteem should look elsewhere.  And finally, who in the world thinks about babies on the first date??
0	History written by a loser. From Lind, verbatim: "Who won and who lost the Vietnam War?  The only complete losers were the officials of South Vietnam, whose state was erased from the map."  May the dead, maimed and mourning    find some comfort that their misery could be yet more abject: they could be suffering the pain of the war's cartographic consequences."Necessary War"? - Unnecessay B.S
0	Anti-family secularist claptrap. I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that bothladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands.I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .
0	It's called the &quot;Rough Guide&quot; because it's rough. This book was a disappointment.  It's information was incomplete and uninformative (and I'm talking about the recent FIFTH Edition -- published in 2002).  Even in the touristy beachy destinations, I did not find the information helpful.  Many of the budget hotels listed were closed, and there were no similar alternatives provided.  Very little historical background for the sites I saw.  Not much value added.  I spent time on the Pacific Coast (not Baja) and in the Central Highlands.  For Nahrit, Jalisco, the Bajio, and Michoacan states, it's practically worthless.  Some of the worst maps in the business (Lonely Planet has excellent maps, so even if its information is lacking, at least you have reliable orientation).  I would be VERY CAREFUL about buying another Rough Guide
0	Read if you must. Reading this book, I find that the author's ego interferes often with the documentation of how America went from Haute cuisine to the modern "American" restaurant.  One particular passage paints his mother (a cook) in the same light as Elizabeth David and M.F.K.Fisher, and leaves me wondering why, if she was so enlightened, do I not see her book on the shelf.  Throughout the book, he comes off as an average cook that could no longer take the heat, and left the kitchen to write.With about 30 pages left to go, I cringe each time I reach for the book to attempt to finish it as what the author must perceive as colorful writing becomes more laborious with each page.That said, there is definitely some interesting information, and if you can indeed labor through some of its issues, and weave around the author's bias, you will be somewhat rewarded.  (I especially found some of the La Pavillion information interesting after finishing Jacques Pepin's autobiography.)Bottom line - if you are seriously interested in reading about American gastronomy, this might we worth a look if you can pick a copy up cheap.  I only wish someone with more skill had taken on the project, as it was, in fact, an excellent idea for a book
0	This book is not what I expected.... I have studied,  practiced and taught managerial accounting for more than 17 years at work, using excellent supporting text and case books from recognized US authors. But to be honest Dr. Kaplan is making easy concepts to appear complicated and cumbersome. His case readings as well as the text materials are very length and hard to &quot;digest&quot; since it does not capture the attention of the reader.I would not recommend the book neither for and undergraduate or graduate degree, despite the well known and worldwide recognition of Dr. Kaplan. His book is far from being pedagogical in nature
0	Average romance novel. i'm a nora roberts fan, so picking up a book of hers to read is something i look forward to. after reading "born in fire", i was eager to find out what kind of romance the cool and collected brianna would find in "born in ice".brianna is a young woman who is uncomfortable with conflict, and because she grew up in a household where her fiery sister maggie and embittered mom maeve were always battling, she developed the ability to keep a calm facade in the face of a storm. she has done a good job of disciplining her emotions to the point where they can't create further conflict, even if she burns with anger inside. she's very family oriented and longs for a husband and family of her own. after being jilted weeks before her wedding a decade before the timing of the story, she thinks she'll never have what she dreams of.she owns a bed and breakfast in a small town in ireland where she is the perfect hostess. she's always hospitable to her guests. she's a gifted artist in both the kitchen and garden, two places she loves to be. although she's surrounded by folks who love her, she's still lonely.and then comes grayson, the american writer who pops in for a couple of months to write a novel as inspired by the scenery and ambience of ireland. he's one who lives in the moment, ignoring his past and unwilling to plan the future because of the commitment and responsibilities such an action would create.the characters compliment each other well. they're both generous and both suffering from childhoods where they didn't feel loved. she's comfortable with the idea of laying down roots but he's not. that's where the conflict comes to play.and that's kinda where i've got a problem with the book. this is supposed to be a guy who doesn't want emotional ties, yet early in the book he's already willingly becoming emotionally attached to her. there simply wasn't enough resistance from him for me to believe he was really afraid of settling down. there was very little if any sexual tension here, and not enough situations to warrant sexual tension. a couple of encounters of kissing and then they were in bed. and even then, it seemed like he wasn't really fighting himself for being there. there simply wasn't enough of an inner conflict within him. it all seemed like lukewarm resistance.and brianna was simply a saint. i would have liked to see her emote a little more. i understand that she was written to be an ice princess of sorts, but i don't think roberts did a good job of depicting her as a character who was a carefully contained boiler. at times i found it difficult to believe brianna could exhibit any kind of real passion with grayson.there were alot of slow moments in the book that made me wishing i was already near the end. i will say that the ending was sweet. also, it was great seeing how the relationship of maggie and rogan progressed from "born in fire".i'd recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the vividness of a writer's imagination, as roberts did a great job with grayson in that respect. however, if you're looking for a "can't put down" romance novel, this ain't it
0	Disappointing. It has nothing but pre-published photos we have all seen before in magazines. The tats aren't even shown. They talk about how Angelina has a lot of them but they don't even list them all. Not made for the true tattoo enthusist. A coffee table book at best. It describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats
0	Don't, Good read but not Good!. Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO
0	Little conceptual explanation. I'm currently using this book for my Process Calculations course. The book has many example problems and covers unit conversions, material balances, energy balances, single phase and multi-phase systems, etc. Yet, the theory is almost non-existent and the reader is presented with a lot of facts and formulae crammed in with very little conceptual emphasis.I do not recommend this book, as an introduction to a process calculations cours
0	Hate it and love it. I hardly know how to describe this book.  When I read it two years ago, my hatred for Pamela (the character) was something of an amusing obsession.  Although Richardson had meant to portray a model of feminine virtue, Pamela is vain, conniving, self-righteous, wordy, and obnoxiously weak.  I cannot think of a more annoying character in literature...Uriah Heep, Lydia Bennett, Newland Archer...all are more tolerable than Pamela.  I find myself rooting for Pamela's ruin.To top everything off, Pamela's great reward for maintaining her virtue is a marriage to the man who had so many times tried to rape her.  As a husband, Mr. B. is temperamental and demanding.  And this is virtue rewarded?  Even by 18th century standards the idea was thought absurd by many, such as Henry Fielding who wrote parodies, Shamela and Joseph Andrews.Yet despite all this, the book is at times entertaining (if for all the wrong reasons) and pleasantly sentimental.  I admit, I hate it and love it.  I searched and searched to find Pamela part II (yes, Richardson actually did write a sequel).  So far it promises to be just as frustrating as part I!
0	How Not To Write a Romance. This book should be an inspiration for romance writers, indeed writers of any genre, because after reading it you are sure you can write a better story. Now getting that story published may be a tad more difficult because you aren't already a best selling writer, but hey we've all got to start somewhere.Jayne Ann Krentz isn't the only writer whose early works fall in the category of head scratchers as in, "Why in the world did anyone buy that manuscript?" Other best selling authors have had less than stellar beginnings and when a begining writer reads these works it gives her courage to keep trying to write and sell her own stories. If you don't fall in this category of reader then maybe you don't want to read this one
0	This is appalling. Teach your kid to use Weights and Measures and poison him/herself with sugar and empty calories at the same time!Perhaps Hershey's should also create a book on Dental Hygiene,weight control and the advantages of hyperactivity.I suppose this is approved by the Bush administration's Dept. of Education.

0	Boring. This story has been done time and time again.  Don't waste your money.  Humor was forced and trite, book was way too long
0	Disgust!. I would prefer to give this book no stars. It is an outdated, sexist look  at the generalizations of men that no longer apply in today's society. I am  amazed that this book is a 1998 publication. It would make better since if  it was published in 1950. I am 25 years old and wanted to find out why my  husband is so different from me in certain aspects. This book was useless,  all it did was offend me, disgust me and lead to arguments with my husband.  It made me feel that I made a bad decision in being heterosexual because I  liked nothing about men and their ways. My husband read through the book  and talked to me about the inaccuracies and made me feel good about men and  him again. I would not suggest this book to anyone under 50, especially if  they are desperately seeking to understand their husband and are dealing  with minor marital problems. This book will only make things worse. Among  the many irritating statements made, my favorite offensive/sexist statement  is: Men's arms are built to swing an ax, while women's are built to cradle  babies. Give me a break! Someone needs to write a book on this subject that  is relative to this day and age. Women and men do struggle with their  differences and it would be so helpful to have an accurate manual to go to  for suggestions. This is not such a manual
0	Thumbs Down for "Terri's Family". Anyone gushing over the "concerned and loving" parent's of Terri Shiavo really needs to read Michael Shiavo's book on the life and death of his wife. Unlike "Terri's Family," he uses real documents, court and hospital records to support his case. He also exposes the Shindler's (in particular, Bob), as being much less concerned with their their daughter's treatment and more more concerned with affording a bigger condo.Terri is finally resting in peace
0	Silly Premise. This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this
0	Not Really A 'Little House' Book At All. The First Four years was released many years after These Happy Golden Years brought a sweet, tidy ending to the series. I did not like this book and it just does not feel like it belongs with the other books. It is about hardship and bitter times and disturbs the harmony of the other titles. I'd recommend serious thought be given before this book is begun
0	Outdated---Ancient History. Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff. I wonder why this book is still being published. Felt like a collection of shorter magazine--newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book. Many long, disjointed sentences. Could use an updating. There must be better books out there about this topic
0	Leaves me cold. This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years.  It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered.  It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are  stereotypical creations of little or no interest.  I was particularly  amused when the detective was told to &quot;make a few inquiries at the  transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the  corpse&quot;.  In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known  &quot;transsexual shoe shop&quot;.  Please.  I suspect Ms. LaPlante has  better material, but this is a poor example better left unread.  I would  give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option
0	Very little sailing...tons of social commentary. I admit I am a resident of the South - Alabama to be exact.  But when I purchased this book, I sincerely wanted to read a story about sailing for a year in the Bahamas.  Sadly, this book is more about a spoiled couple that spends about 25% of the time telling you how scared they are about every aspect of the trip and 50% of the time criticizing the social conditions of the "South" as they travel down the ICW on the East Coast.  The other 25% of the time is spent talking about random ideas with a few sentences of the sailing trip they are supposedly on.  By page 70 I was tired of their liberal slant on a part of the US they claim to be "from".  Message to the author, I live in Birmingham.  Rosa Parks made her heroic stand against racial injustice in Montgomery.  Simple facts like this seem to be trivial to the authors who are more concerned with expressing their overall disgust with a South that has seemingly not changed much since the days of slavery.  Well, I certainly wouldn't say everything is perfect here, but as the authors admit, nowhere is perfect.  The Southeast is one of the fastest growing regions for economical development and changes are taking place.  Birmingham does boast to be the birth place for Civil Rights and we have an excellent Civil Rights museum that I have taken the time to actually visit to learn of the past injustices with the hope that I will be part of a better place for all.  I resent being lectured to by the main author who evidently loves his teaching job.  And if he does want to lecture this Southerner, I would expect him to take time to at least learn some of the more major details of the Civil Rights movement.Very little sailing story.  Lots of liberal opinions spewed forth as though they were facts when even his facts are wrong.  If you want to read about a sailing story....buy Sailing the Dream.  I am going to return my copy of this book to the author.  I may even take a red pen and mark all of his errors.  I would give him a grade of "F" if I were his professor
0	Left Behind Series. The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read.

0	a little bit dry. I read through this book and found it fairly hard to digest. It seems too "academic" for me. An amateur like me probably won't be able to get anything meaningful out of it
0	Based on Incorrect Facts. This is the first time I've given a book the minimum rating.I bought this book in the hope that it would help me consider whether the Purpose-Driven Life/Church is more 'secular philosophy influencing church beliefs' than 'the church bringing God's revelation to the world'.  However, it quickly became apparent that the basis of this book is fundamentally flawed, as the author gets many basic facts wrong.The problems can best be illustrated by looking at Appendix A, where the author contrasts 'Psychology' with the Bible.  I'll describe the errors as they apply to Jungian psychology, as this is one of the main targets for the author in the book and is something of which I have some knowledge.Example Errors--------------(1) Fear of the LordPoint 1 of the appendix says psychology "counsels no fear of the Lord at anytime.." with the Bible teaching that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  Yet Carl Jung wrote: "It is quite right, therefore, that the fear of God should be considered the beginning of all wisdom... Both are justified, the fear of God as well as the love of God" (Completed Works Volume 11, p419).(2) Jung and atheismPoint 2 of the appendix says "Most founding fathers were atheists or humanists... including.. Jung"  In fact, Carl Jung famously asserted his absolute knowledge of God's existence in a BBC documentary made shortly before he died.  The atheist Richard Dawkins described Jung as believing in a "100% probability of God" (The God Delusion, p50).(3) Body, Mind, Soul, Personality... and SpiritPoint 3 of the Appendix declares that psychology does not acknowledge the spirit in man.  Yet Carl Jung's writings are packed with discussion of the spirit.  Just in case you think that by 'spirit' he really meant 'mind', Jung wrote: "Spirit, like God... cannot be proved to exist in the external world and cannot be understood rationally" (CW 8, p 329).  This clearly distinguishes spirit from mind/body/personality, all of which can be studied scientifically/rationally.(4) Eternal HopePoint 4 of the appendix contrasts psychology, as offering no hope for eternity, with the Bible that teaches us about our eternal destiny.  But Jung's view was that "eternity..[is] the prerogative of the One God". (CW11, p493).(5) The Holy SpiritPoint 5 of the appendix declares "Psychology doesn't even believe in the Holy Spirit".  In contrast, Jung wrote: "the Paraclete [ie: Holy Spirit] is of the greatest significance" (CW11, p433), and "Since the Holy Ghost is the Third Person of the Trinity and God is present entire in each of the three Persons at any time, the indwelling of the Holy Ghost means nothing less than an approximation of the believer to the status of God's son." (CW11, p413).The author goes on to make 35 points of comparison between Psychology and Scripture, and in regards Jungian Psychology I take issue with most of them.  Please don't misunderstand me: I'm not saying that Jung's views should be taken uncritically by any means, he says many things that are highly controversial.  But this book is based on straw man arguments.The spirit in which it is written---------------------------------I felt very uncomfortable with the tone taken in the book towards Rick Warren.  His name is used several times on most pages, when making points of criticism, giving it the feel of a sustained, personal attack.  He is often placed in double-binds (eg: he is criticised for saying that Willow Creek back his programmes, because it is not the Lord's backing!).Rick Warren is also labelled early on in the book as a 'heretic', which is a very serious charge.  But he is then criticised for statements such as "meditation is focused thinking" and  "your personal testimony is more effective than a sermon" and "faithfulness has always been a rare quality".Are these really matters of fundamental heresy to which 1 Timothy 4 might be relevant?  They seem to me to be merely disputable matters that fall into the province of Romans 14.Conclusion----------The Purpose-Driven approach has pervaded the church so much that I think there is a need for a book like this to question and challenge what is happening.  Unfortunately, whilst this book may contain fine-sounding argument, it does not contain sound argument, because of the many elementary factual mistakes.

0	One of the most deceptive books ever written. There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this "sermon" has been to all who have read or heard it.  The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a "hell".  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  "Hell" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and "converting" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as "orthodox" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young's Literal propagate this fallacy.Do your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.  Do the research from a non-traditional, non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.Other HIGHLY recommended books are "The Inescapable Love of God" by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312, not on Amazon, you must google it), "The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment" by Thomas Thayer, "The Bible Hell" by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.  Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what "hell" is and where it came from.  You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on, to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.  THAT is hell indeed, and THAT is the ONLY hell that exists
0	Forgettable Italo chiller. International noir hits rock-bottom with one of the latest outing of this midlist Italian author. A wannabe psychothriller, Almost Blue could only satisfy the staunchest defenders of old whodunits, what with its trite plot and its absolute contempt for logic. And, the less said about the writing style, the better. Is this all Italy got to offer? We shudder at the mere thought..
0	Man, what tough going !. What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking "OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity
0	Counting the trees and missing the forest. I had been looking forward to reading this book because of research I'm doing on a related topic.  I'm not a Catholic and certainly not a nun but I am definitely a Christian and interested in how the Good News intertwines with American history.I was so disappointed in Ms. Carey's approach that I felt downright cheated as a reader. As another reviewer notes, Ms. Carey looses her journalist perspective in this book...if there ever was any, I would add. Certainly by page 15, last sentence of the second paragraph, it is gone entirely.  Too bad, because she has done respectable research.  I wondered who was paying for the book since the slantedness is so pronounced. The tragedy for the reader is that the more complete, compelling and difficult truths are washed out in easy-to-swallow platitudes.The section on the Sister Survey has tremendous 'meat' in it, and Carey should be commended for bringing data forward.  She fails, however, to put a context on the data beyond "he said/she said" and leaves the reader to pick up on all the well-placed inferences from previous chapters. In short, there is no in-depth thinking and, as another reviewer points out, she reveals clear personal contempt for the 'change-sisters' as a basis for those conclusions she does draw.For me, the most significant shortcoming of the work is the lack of adequate consideration to what was happening TO the sisters, to the church as a whole in the U.S. (its overall relationship to European mothershouses and even to Rome) and to the communities that the sisters had been serving. Significant poltical, economic and social upheavals in the post WWII America cannot simply be wisked away as 'new age' stuff.  It is inconceivable that these upheavals failed to act upon the individual and the community characteristics of religious women any less than they left their mark on Americans as a whole...where/how we lived, our values, our music, our hopes or lack thereof.  The notion that the decline of religious sisters' groups is due to internal struggles between persuasive 'change sisters' and apparently passive 'traditional sisters', albeit sparked by Vatican II, is so naive as to be stunning. Yet, that is the message that Ms. Carey brings home more than once.Even viewed with the narrow inward-looking perspective that dominates the book, no serious consideration was given to the problem of how women religious communities were faring economically, what had caused their economic crises and the impact that community economics had on the outlook of the sisters. Blaming the dilemmas on changing from traditional habit to secular clothes is not a sufficiently comprehensive answer for me.One psychologist (not a reveiwer) has suggested that one of the possible reasons why social justice was of such interest to many of the 'new' sisters is because their own situation was so unjust.  Delve into the on/again-off/again -- mostly WAY off -- support provided to women religious vs priests in some diocesan areas and one wonders how justice was served at all. Clearly that's a whole book unto itself.Finally, Ms. Carey's work seems to belie a preference for Euro-dominated orders as the ideal - although never stated like that. If that is correct, then it helps make some sense of why 'change sisters' are so abhorent in her view. Sort of like some British still preferring to think of us as 'the colonies.'Not coming from that tradition, I'd have to say that I don't share her notion. I feel that Ms. Carey put together a goodly amount of data and then proceded to count the trees instead of seeing the forest or well beyond.

0	Christian Marxist. I was excited to read this book as it is on the reading list for a theology course at Wheaton College.  It didn't take me long to figure out Walsh and Keesmaat are theologians who like to write from a "new perspective" that is really the same old political liberalism of the left. They just don't get it.  After reading their views on 9/11, the US Military, their praise of food coops, and their negative comments about coroporate America I am surprised they do not teach at Berkeley on the left coast.  The Gospel really is simple; they make it synonymous with the liberal agenda
0	This book is pure baloney and propaganda. Global warming is not controversial among scientists.  For many years, there has been almost universal agreement among climate scientists that global warming is happening, and that human pollution is largely responsible.So why is this still controversial?  Largely because a handful of skeptics, like Michaels, have thrown up a dust cloud of confusion around the issue through popular books, newspaper opinion pieces, television and radio appearances, and other tactics.  They have skillfully exploited the media's desire for "balance" in their reporting, when in fact, they are in an extreme, scientifically isolated minority.  Many politicians have been swept up in their deceptions.Michaels gets huge amounts of money from the coal and oil industries, which stand to lose if we start getting serious about addressing climate change.  Doesn't that say it all about this man's credibility
0	actors not authors. I usually am entertained by the aforementioned actors, but authors, they are not.  I had less of a problem with Garofalo's banter, but Stiller, made no mistake about mentioning over and over that he was writing the book for the advance and the revenue that it would supply.  Stiller's voice can virtually be heard through his writing which was just innane banter thrown down on a page and attached to his name with the hope that it would draw readers.  This book is not worth the time or the money that in essence is exactly what the authors were after.  Their apparent motives are insulting to their fans and readers
0	same old same old. This book has the same old information you have already heard.  I really did not like this book.  It had several items that are false in it, like gorillas eat meat, which they do not.  It has lots of negative information on various foods but offers no suggestions on where to buy an alternative product.  I just do not see the point of adding this book to your library or collection.  No new information whatsoever
0	Sappho Would've Leapt After Reading This. That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever
0	mostly sloppy and uniformed with a few good bits. Ambrose writes in a mostly accessible style which is not a bad thing, but this book is a mish mash of different magazine pieces that have virtually nothing in common and are quite uneven in quality.  Further, some of his work is just pure opinion based on almost no real scholarship, (his arguments about the bombing of japan or the cold war come to mind).  For armchair historians who think they "know" alot about history, Ambrose is the man, unfortunately his unfaultering US boosterism which results in obvious, moth-worn and erroneous conclusions will not really appeal to anyone else
0	Why Do Cultural Ctitics Have To Write Like This?. OK--I know that Nina Auerbach is a famous, groundbreaking feminist literary critic.  I don't disagree with many of her points in this book. (Though I'm innately suspicious of any system that fits as perfectly as hers does.  She never seems to find an example that doesn't fit her thesis--rather like an undergraduate writing a paper and discarding any evidence that doesn't fit.)  And I am interested in cultual criticism--particularly the idea that horror fiction reflects the fears, desires, and fixations of particular time periods.  This said, I found Auerbach's book tough slogging.  Why do cultural critics seem to feel that the "lower" the text they're criticizing, the more jargon-filled, pedantic, and convulted their prose style must become?  The endlessly long sentences with their multpile references and their twisting, parenthetical asides made my eyes glaze over.  Certainly Auerbach is not the worst prose stylist of any academic I've read, but this fact, itself, is an indictment of the kind of writing that gets university professors published these days.So, yes, there are insights and arguments in this book that make it worth reading.  But I found the experience of reading the book a rather depressing enterprise, and it made me long for clearer, livlier, and more accessible writing from theorists and literary critics.  I can't say that I'm optimistic on this count
0	nothin much here. This is like the other cambridge companions: it is not a reference work, is not thorough, is not authoritative nor objective. This is a collection of essays tending toward the highly speculative, each around 50 pages in length. They range from the silly to the ok, and none are very impressive. The cambridge companion series is misleadingly titled. They cater to narrow interests, not to the general public. Students who need a basic understanding of Nietzsche before they start delving into special topics will find almost no assistance here. Most of the material is of the professorial, specialized, not-generally-interesting variety
0	Everyone Loves Una; Or, The Navel-Gazer: A Mary Sue. I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked.
0	Wasted Space. I was very disappointed with the content and layout of this book.  The amount of wasted pages for 'workspace' is excessive, but considering the lack of true content, I assume they needed to fill pages with something.
0	Weak, Lacking Depth and Dated material. I've read many books in this segment and I would strongly recommend reading Hot Text: Web Writing that Works or Networds. Robert Bly is a &quot;print guy&quot; that thought it would be interesting to write a book on electronic copy.  I would say that the first half of the book is written by supposed experts in on-line marketing.  The book is crowded with all sorts of references to other people's work. This leads to a very choppy style of reading in my opinion.  The author uses case studies from work that he has already completed but rarely does the content match the electronic world.  For a book that is written in 2003, the data is incredibly dated. The author is comfortable with using data from 1996 in a book that talks about the ever changing environment of On-Line marketing.  Most of the data regarding internet statistics was incredibly dated. The author talks  about the principals of good copy writing but rarely goes into any depth with regards to examples of the principals.  I found the writing to be lazy to say the least.  Clearly this author is capitalizing on the interest of electronic copy.  Take out the experts that know about on-line marketing, you're left with an incredibly weak book.  Although there are is a lot of expert reference, rarely do the experts go into any depth with regards to their arguments or points.  If  this book is the only book that you are exposed to within this segment; you might be left thinking that you read an average book. When you compare the book to other books in the same segment, it simply doesn't compare.  Not a good book
0	Another unfortunate representation. As much as America needs a real understanding of the Indochina conflict, this work falls drastically short.  The sources sighted are the typical biased rationalizations void of depth and understanding.  Anyone with an elementary wish to finding truth in mid to late twentieth century Indochina has merely to check whether actual primary participants were used in the construction of this work.  Clearly, they were not.  As an examination of American political decision making it may have certain merit.  It is however impossible to gain a full understanding of the decisions without knowledge of the depth of the situations.  This book does not do that.  Clips taken out of context from the FRUS (Foreign Relations of the United States) compilations are not a substitute for scholarly research.  This work is long on pages, but short on understanding
0	Very pretty book, some ideas but not that good. &quot;The Home Organizing Workbook&quot; by Meryl Starr is the type of book that is design to catch the reader attention of the shelve. But, once the reader takes a close look at it. The reader begins to realize that while it has some useful information there are better organizing books on the market. If you are interesting reading it, just check it out, and save your money
0	Annoyed. I wanted to read this book because of the impact of 'Midnight Express&quot; and was curious as to why he then had such a sparse career. Now I know. His tragically short life is sad, as it is for anyone...but I  couldn't get past being annoyed by how careless he was with the people in  his life and careless about his career.  He was good, then he seemed to  blow it with bad behavior. I know there are reasons for it, but I could  only feel sorry to a point. A lot of my annoyance was the &quot;name  dropping&quot;..Susan's reference to would-be stars &quot;then&quot; and  informing us as to who they have become... as if we the public would not  know.  I have the feeling she wanted some vindication for what she went  through, some acknowledgement for her perseverence...and some legacy of  value for her husband. Who can blame her. So many people have died of AIDS,  so many horrific stories of ordinary people who never had a voice. I guess  I get annoyed that people look to Hollywood for their heroes
0	wrong item sent. I received a book that I didn't even order.  The one I ordered is yellow and white ( 3th edition).  THis isn't the one I ordered; therefore, I need a refund.I sent the book back and I know the seller received it on 8/19
0	Everything Is A Conspiracy These Days. I bristle at the suggestion that perhaps Roosevelt knew of the attack but did nothing to stop it, as if a repulsed sneak attack would not have convinced America to go to war.  The conspiracy theory holds that Roosevelt had the carriers shipped out of Pearl, leaving the obsolete battleships to be destroyed in the attack.  The one glaring problem with this theory (actually there are several problems, but I consider this the most compelling) can be summarized in a single word: oil.  A HUGE amount of oil was stored at Pearl, such a huge amount in fact that the carriers and subs would have been out of action probably for an entire year, if the oil had been destroyed.  The value of that oil was tremendous, and Roosevelt would have been absolutely demented to risk it.  It was pure luck that the Japanese did not target it (they actually planned to hit it on the aborted third run).  Additionally, Roosevelt was a former Navy Secretary who referred to the Army as &quot;them&quot; and the Navy as &quot;us&quot;.  It is way beyond belief that he would have sacrificed the battleships and their crews, much less the oil.  It's always sooooo simple to monday morning quarterback, a lesson to keep in mind today regarding Iraqi WMD
0	Utopic.  Islamic Insurrection is not imploding. The author develops an original argument that the Islamic insurrection is imploding on its own.  In other words,  Osama bin Laden's Jihad is viewed as intolerable terror against innocent civilians by a majority of Muslims.  Over time, the Muslim peace lovers will progressively dwarf the ranks of the Jihadists.In the author's mind, this is especially true if the U.S. gets out of the way and stop waging an ill fated War on Terror that keeps throwing oil on the fire of the Jihad movement.  He makes a case that the U.S. ongoing backing of Israel and its invasion of Iraq have strongly boosted Al Qaeda's ranks.The author belongs to the camp that believe that the Islamic insurrection is almost solely a counter reaction to U.S. foreign policy.  It certainly is a factor, but how can it be the main driver?  9/11 was totally unsolicited.  Also, prior act of terrorism were more often than not caused by the U.S. government becoming friendlier towards various Middle Eastern ones rather than the opposite.  Thus, whether the U.S. supports or attacks a Middle Eastern state, it appears as justification for act of Islamic terrorism.  What kind of rational is that.The Pew Global Attitudes surveys and current events don't support any of the author's original arguments.  Osama bin Laden's aura is ever increasing.  Islam is becoming increasingly fundamentalist and violent throughout the Middle East and Africa.  Wherever it overlaps with Christian population bloodshed results more often than not executed by the Muslims and suffered by the Christians such as in Somalia, Rwanda, and Sudan.So, the main thesis of letting Islam extremism implode on its own just does not hold well to any reality check.  Right now it is picking up steam big time.Instead, I recommend a far more prescient book on the subject: Samuel Huntington's "The Clash of Civilizations."  He has a far better understanding of Islam's extremism from a geopolitical and demographic standpoints.
0	Pretentious text, weird typography. If you want to read a "presuppositionalist" defense of militantly unregenerate Calvinism, I'd suggest EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE by Richard Pratt instead. It's much clearer, it's written in far better English, it's unpretentious, and it will take up a lot less of your time.The text of this book looks as though it was photographed from a cut-and-paste of miscellaneous typescripts of different text sizes. The typographical variations appear to have no function. Just another irritation in a pretentious and windy book
0	Disappointing...very. I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James
0	Just Not Up To Ms. Hooper's Normal Standards!!!. I've been like many reviewers a long time fan of this author and have found this latest "Evil" novel to be less then inspiring, or fun to read.It does read like a textbook as far as the topic of psychic issues.  Our teaching was couched in conversation normally between Rafe and Isabel. We would hit these class lectures normally right in the middle of the murder/mystery portion of the book, and I would just be getting into the meat of the story, and then I would be derailed by "too much information."  This is not to say that I don't care for instuction and added background.  I do, but there is a time when it is just too much.  We unfortunatly hit this wall of information throughout the story.This was just an okay read.  There was plenty of suspense (who was doing all of the killing and why) but I just felt that the fleshing out of the storyline, as well as character development was not truly priorty while writing the novel.  The relationship between Rafe and Isabel was rather confusing.  She spent most of her time lecturing him on paranormal issues, and less time letting her hair down and being relaxed while she was with him socially.To be honest I did skim a few pages, but still, I was okay as far as not missing anything important.  This was not her strongest effort and if you are picking Ms. Hooper up for the first time I highly recommend her other earlier reads or even the other two "Evil" reads.  An author can't be on "top" all of the time and we should just remember that she is capable of doing so much better.  I'm really looking forward to her latest series she has started that will still feature Bishop and his team, and hope that she is back on track as the author we love.Official reviewer www.romancedesigns.co
0	Mark of the Beast is MONEY. "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.For more information see www.666isMONEY.co
0	revenge of the whale not a good book you better not read it. i read this book the reveng of the whale.it is about a huge sperm whale that attacks a ship that is trying to capturen it.they are trying to kill it beacuse of the sperm oil it has.they bring it back to land and sell it.i didnt like the book becase it didnt really have a main charecter.all it talked about is what the ship did and how they capiutur the whales.i also didnt like it because i thought it was going to have more action in it.most of the time ther just sailing and not really doing anything really exiting.it also dont really have a story line all it talkes about is what the ship is doing.it has no charecter conflicts.i was expecting more fights seenes with the whale and i would have hopped the would have discribed the whale better and how it attacked the ship more.some of the things i did like about it was it had one vwery god part in it.when the capterd one of the whales.it told how the got it and what they had to do to get it.i also like the pictures in the book it showed what the whales looked like and all the tools they had.i really didnt like this book but if you read it mabey you will u might be suprised
0	Funny, but under this guise should provide actual guidance. A good helping of humor is good for potential grooms, but most of us need more substantial info along with it.  This book does provide a few good laughs (like the description of a diamond as an &quot;overdigested lump of  coal -- the kidney stone of earth's urinary tract),&quot;  but if you are  looking for actual guidance - which you most likely will need - look  elsewhere in the handful of books for grooms
0	written on childish intellectual level, yet not even good as that. I read about half the book before calling it quits for good.  I love the real Issaac Asimov stories, but this is not even a respectable imitator (if there are any at all).First, we are expected to buy the idea of time travel into the past--a logical impossibility that has occasionally been gotten away with when there was great action or character development to compensate.  Halfway through, I realized that this book would have neither of these.  Instead, two of the main characters, an outdoorsman and paleantologist inexplicably bicker with each other about nothing at all, from the moment they meet.Wu's hidden agenda seems to be to advocate environmentalism, a religion the daily tabloids and ivory tower politician/pseudo-scientists are doing enough to disseminate on their own.This is not even good for children, as it is poorly written, is philosophically flawed, and is uselessly descriptive (e.g., the main female character is described as 'pretty'...so what?).Fortunately, I've yet to read over half of the REAL Asimov stories, so I have something to look forward to.
0	Simplistic advice. The advice given in this book is really so banal that I suppose anyone could have written the book. I really don't understand why there has been so much attention given to the concept of emotional intelligence.  Seems to me that normal folks are, according to the description of the authors, emotionally intelligent.  No need to write books about something that's so  obvious. Is it maybe written for those you lack the real intelligence
0	Not impressed. The authors seemed to spend more time asking you if you really, really, really want to get a poodle, considering all the work and money they take, than on giving valuable information.  Not very helpful to those of us who already have a poodle and want to learn more about our dog/puppy, and caring for them.  It does have chapters on care and grooming, etc, but for the first several chapters it seemed to be cautioning people away from getting a poodle, at least that was the impression I had
0	Really bad ending. I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me
0	Not for neophytes. Beware, if you are not familiar with the tools and commands of this program, this book is not for you. The author, particularly in the early portions of the book, skips steps and gives incorrect information.For example, in the directions for creating a "honeycomb graphic," the author says to create a "five-sided polygon" (p. 32). Without seeing that Figure 2.21 shows a six-sided polygon, a new person will create this polygon according to directions and be totally frustrated with the fact that the sides are slanted and in no way will create the object needed for this exercise. After creating the correct polygon, the author says to connect the 26 corner points. However, without being able to see the majority of these corner points due to lack of directions (a person familiar with the program would probably know the right steps to take here), there is no way to complete this exercise.This is just one example; there are many such problems in this book. Not only are there missing steps in exercises, there are missing words in sentences which makes it hard to follow.I would not recommend this book for someone just starting out in Flash MX 2004. On the other hand, if you are familiar with the program or a mind reader, you can overlook some of these problems. The whining about what was wrong with the program didn't help either
0	I just don't understand. Why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book?  Honestly, what has this author contributed to the world with this book?  Was it the characters?  No, they've all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years (i.e. cocky and handsome FBI agent, beautiful but dangerous killer with a past, take-no-sh#t FBI boss, etc.).  Was it the deep insight into the characters themselves?  A laugh out loud, "No!".  There was nothing coming close to character development.  Was there some new and clever writing style?  Unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary (I call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel).  How about the plot?  Was that something worth my time?  Not unless you haven't ever watched suspence movie in your life.So honestly, what the hell makes this book worth anyone's time?  All I can find in this book are two dimensional characters, needless sub-plots, ludicris dialogue, and empty promises (we're lied to about the main character's fate in the beginning and we're lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of Hitchcock).As a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape Hollywood's onslaught of needless, pointless, and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage I can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money.This man does not deserve our money and certainly does not deserve to write anything other than an apology letter to the world for dumbing us down into thinking that this type of writing is anything other than trash
0	Would not recommend this book to anyone. I was really surprised at how bad this book was.  It was terribly written and cheesy.  Both of the main characters are completely unbelievable - the author describes Joshua Seigl as though he were an 80 year old man - he is supposed to be in his late 30's.  He wears tweed caps, and calls people "darling"??  Even for a "literary" type, completely off the mark.  His whole persona was like something out of the depression.  As for the Tattooed Girl, this character was also annoyingly unbelievable.  No one under the age of 70 uses the word "Jewess" - EVER.  This book reminded me of a book that an adult wrote for children, completely failing to grasp a certain time and place.CHEESY and overwritten.  But, naturally, I had to finish it, and I was glad when I did.
0	dont buy it. there is no information giving. it took me 2 hours to finish whole book, which is less than 50 pgs.dont buy it
0	Series hits a brick wall. This is the third installment in the Mitch Rapp series and the author's fourth book overall. (I'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they're better reads.) Mitch is America's #1 "go to" guy when it comes to fighting terrorism. In "Separation of Power" he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission (someone tried to kill him), the political "in-fighting" surrounding the naming of a new CIA chief, rogue Mossad agents, Iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love. One could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents WW III. Not so. Mitch's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic. The "action" threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first 100 pages, doesn't really begin until after 200 pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts. There is an inordinate amount of "character development" - self-serving, amoral, scheming politicans & our world weary, battle scarred reluctant hero Mitch, who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the "romance" impedes the plot. The book hastily concludes, (20+ pages), in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale. Hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports. Unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and Mitch's "new" situation doesn't guarantee that.
0	Am I the only one...?. I read this book many years ago, and thought it was terrible.  Looking through the reviews just now, I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were, and just had to put in a word for those of us (and I assume/hope there are others) who didn't like the book.The book is ludicrously long, and meanders through way too many red herrings, dead ends, and nonsequitirs.  There are any number of sub-plots that appear out of nowhwere, go nowhere, never pay off, and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all.The sub-plots, though, are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself.  It's a very uninspiring story about a business deal.  Will person A get the contract, or will person B?  A business deal?  Who cares?SPOILER ALERT:And then, after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal, at the end one of the characters randomly dies, and the whole thing just peters out.  No climax, no drama, nothing.I also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters.  I found that Clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect, carried out too far in this book.  All of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on.  These are not real people, they're supermen who I couldn't relate to at all.It's boring, it's long, it's badly written.  I was particularly disappointed because I loved Shogun and liked Tai-pan and King Rat.  But after this one, I've never read another Clavell book, and I don't think I will
0	Interesting subject - poorly written. Although it was a chore to overlook the poor writing - the stories were interesting.  However, because the writing was so poor, especially from someone so well educated, I can't help but doubt the author's credibility
0	Rubbish. A conservative, but well-meaning friend of mine lent me this book. Upon first read I was astounded continuously by the utter tripe that dribbles from one page to the next in a viscous stream of fetid crap.This is taken from the website dedicated to this book, "Greatness.com".I have believed, and taught, that only two nations ever were ordained of God for Greatness! Israel and America! This is a must read for everyone, but especially for clergy and others in key leadership. We must be moved to action and the saving of the freedoms of our great Nation.The road to saving freedoms lies in cutting taxes for the rich?The road to saving personal freedom lies in developer more and more sophisticated nukes?How about the Russia and China "Military build up" chapters?Does this mental midget not understand the utter incapacity of either of those nations to even pose a threat to us? ( thanks to the gillions we invest in defense )This is just utter and complete crap. This entire book from front to back is an affront to Christianity, the supposed centerpiece of its ideology. I'm not surprised America elected George Bush with Budwesier-swigging armchair generals like this man actually receiving acolades for such trash
0	American Mania: When less would have been better. Peter Whybrow's finest moments are to be found at the beginning and at the end of this book, in which he provides an eloquent, impassioned and highly quotable critique of contemporary American society.  Ideally, these two sections should be treated as independent essays, because they really don't deserve to go down with the rest of the ship - which, in this case, is a very long exposition of an error-ridden, poorly (though lengthily)defended, and, well, just plain wrong, hypothesis. The short version of Whybrow's thesis is that Americans are "manic" because America was populated by migrants who were curiousity-driven risk-takers, and that, somehow, this resulted in changes in neurobiology which in turn perpetuate (and perhaps create - this was vague) the inability to be satified with "enough."  One might expect this kind of individualistic theory from a psychiatrist, which is a profession that frequently misses the larger picture.  What one doesn't expect is the degree to which Whybrow explores the migrant "mind-set" without offering a shred of evidence for its existence.  (No "evidence" can be offered.  Most of these early migrants are quite thoroughly dead.) Notwithstanding the fact that a significant proportion of migrants came to America against their will (Africans, Chinese, and most women to name a few) there simply is no means to evaluate whether any migrant group anywhere experiences a shift in the activity of neurochemicals.  To claim otherwise is sheer nonsense.Whybrow makes a fine attempt at appearing to offer support for his claims by quoting from venerable old dinosaurs. Although Whybrow quotes at considerable length from Adam Smith, giving the reader the false impression that Whybrow understands economics, he does not analyze America's manic spending with depth. Instead, he offers a series of broad, well-known statistics about wealth distribution, economic trends, etc, which tell us very little about the actual psychology involved in our supposed spending frenzy.All this could be forgiven had there been an adequate amount of thought put into the central tenets which form the bulk the book.  But here again, Whybrow falls short.  He tends to rely on popular prejudices more than actual research.  His blythe claim that the fall of Soviet Russia signaled the triumph of laissez faire capitalism over communism stands as one of the more ridiculous statements in the book.  (Not withstanding the very obvious communist elephant in the room - China - no reputable economist on the past 200 years actually treats laissez faire capitalism as anything more than a quaint myth.) His assumption that obesity is somehow related to unbridled greed is equally absurd.  When was the last time you saw an obese CEO? A simple comparative field trip to a McDonald's, and let's say, a high-end French restaurant on the upper east side would have added a vital piece of factual information so deplorably missing from Whybrow's analysis.  For, unlike the exec-moms and financial wiz-kids who Whybrow seems to think are representative samples of "America" your average wage-earner does not suffer from "over-scheduled" children, jet-lagged interpersonal relations, and turbo-charged consumption.If you want to read a well-written exposition of some of the unfounded myths "explaining" contemporary America, then this book is for you.  If not, then read Jared Diamond, Kevin Phillips, or Chalmers Johnson.
0	Self-focused marketing in action. Even though Don Peppers and Martha Rodgers have seized and even created opportunities to promote CRM and 1 to 1 marketing, this book provides no true thought leadership.  The only redeemable aspect of the writing are  some real world high level examples of proactive customer relationship  building.  Not anything extraordinary, but enough from some large company  top execs. to get an understanding that a customer-focused business can  only be successful if the culture is nutured from the top down.  The book  does one thing very well; it promotes future Peppers and Rodgers writings  that hopefully have more pratical application.  The fact that the authors  ask the readers to send their thoughts and ideas on specific topics to  unique addresses, of the 1to1 Peppers and Rodgers web site, definitely  follows the CRM philosophy.  Not to mention, gives them a bank of  real-world experience to draw from for their next project. I recommend  looking elsewhere for any &quot;real meat&quot; relevant to CRM strategy  lessons
0	Christian slop for the dumbed-down. I see some have given reviews that Marrs researched his subject area well. What he's done is give some conspiratorial reason for life as we know it. He connects unrelated dots and makes so many egregious errors its not even worth mentioning.Because some guy makes some "connections" and offers cockamamie theories disguised as "insight' and "knowledge" doesn't make them true, people. I used to be a Fundie Christian, but I could never quite understand how some supposed intelligent people could believe such utter toxic waste and even more so when less and less evidence produced. The structure of a cult has it that you recruit the brainier types. For some reason they are easier to bamboozle. Intellectual morons are what they're called in some circles. I'm not saying Christians are intelligent (from my experience, quite the opposite, but the leaders are), but those who are "intelligent" are blind, arrogant (usually), make massive conclusions based upon virtually nothing and fit the same pattern as the Christians who destroyed ancient Rome and brought on the Dark Ages. What was rumor and innuendo (usually stemming from paranoia and slop originating from the authors of books like the subject of this review) ends up being cirulated and recirculated to the point that within these circles it becomes some NWO and Luciferian reality. Scary ain't it? Then, they cause wars to take place in far-flung places like Iraq so to bring about the death and chaos and so the Messiah can ride down and impose his version of a dictatorship and meanwhile our "good" Christians get to rule with a iron rod. Sounds like fantasy, right? Not to these psychos. Because they are psychotic in their actions and the delivery system is Christ-insanity. Allow this mental toxic waste to propagate then you got another Dark Ages with added life destroying methods like bio warfare, nuclear weapons and environmental degradation. All for the arrival of the Messiah!Anyway, people, this guy, Mr. Marrs, repesents the same forces that destroyed European culture and achievement (thus relagating her to backwater status) for over 1,000 years, commencing with the Dark Ages where all knowledge and old ways were considered evil and heretical. Of the DEVIL! Lucifer, Baal, Satan, Molech, you get the drift.I believe some "belief-systems" are toxic waste waiting to destroy in the name of love and grace. Christ-insanity is one such cult gone wild. If it blossoms again be prepared for incessant wars to bring about the Messiah and a earth destroyed for their paranoid and evil delusions. THEY are the EVIL ones folks! The greatest country as yet (eventhough its tarnished now) is probably the USA due to a farreaching and foresight oriented document called "The Constitution". The men that brought it about were mostly Freemasons and Deists. They didn't want the same petty religious squabbles that were happening in Britian between various psychopathic Christian factions to inundate the new America. The Puritans, for example, were persecuted by rival Christian factions and when they obtained power became the persecutors. I've researched how the Christians really acted in ancient Rome. They targetted higher ups (rich, wealthy, senators) to convert and then plotted and succeeded in controlling the Roman state, i.e. Constantine. They used basically the same tactics as early to modern communists. Scheming and doing everything possible to destroy the Roman state so through a chaos scenario they can usurp it. They did more than that. Then they destroyed all the vestiges of the old relgions, banned all freedom of thought, annihilated science, philosophy and other disciplines. Europe didn't slink out of this until the Renaissance. Meanwhile, guys like Marrs would say how the Pope or some other religious leader was evil and of "the Devil" and the cycle would endlessly repeat over and over and over.....until the madness abates with reason and open inquiry without the fear of being put in the Iron Maiden for heretical thoughts. For example, Germany, in the 30 Years War in the early 1600s was turned into a wasteland (1/2 of the population destroyed) due to Marrsesque madness.Folks, there is a conspiracy, mostly of very wealthy, high level, types who want to hold onto their shekels to the detriment of all. Basic human pettiness and greed is the most part. They use Democrazy and conflicting factions (religious and ethnic - divide and conquer) to hold basic control and offer the illusion of *voting*. Bearing in mind the sleazebag politicians will do whatever gives them a new car or vacation and knowing *selling out* has become a virtue. They, these guys and politicians, are criminals for the most part destroying the planet, our health, our very existence. However, because of their utter and complete corruption they will go down and no amount of BS democrazy is going to save their sorry asses when all their ill-gotten wealth and property (maybe even *more*) is confiscated. It is another cycle and it will happen sooner than you think. So forget about numbnuts Marrs and his drivel for the slow witted. These a**holes that I described will crash & burn soon enough. This is due to organic historical cycles and a shifting of wealth and power. I can only hope a strong man comes about that makes them pay dearly for their arrogance and greed. Ruthless action is what will come my friends and when it does they won't have any place to hide.
0	Over Rated. I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book
0	poorly organized. The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine.  That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word.  This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows.  So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good
0	A Painful and Slow Read. This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere
0	'94 Blackstone Audio is AWFUL. The 1994 Blackstone Audio Book version of "Turn of the Screw" is read by Pat Bottino.  Mr. Bottino's uninspired presentation destroyed the story.Perhaps Mr. Bottino got better in later ventures, I don't know, but he mangled "Turn".Avoid this version at all costs
0	One percent of 9 trillion is????. Page 328:"... For example, out of a worldwide total of $9 trillion in international bank loans and deposits in 2001, only about $700 billion went to poor countries-less than one percent. Out of $12 trillion in international investment securities, only about $600 billion went to poor countries, an even smaller fraction of one percent. ..."I really enjoyed this book until I read this passage, now I'm doubting everything I've ever learned about math
0	Ordinary does not have to be ugly. This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste.
0	Something like an enema. I'm going to wait until it gets cold enough to burn this guy's book. "Oblivion," couldn't be a better title, while reading these stories--I couldn't actually bear to finish even one of them-- you feel as if you have entered some circle of Hell, and your punishment is to have to read all this crap. This guy makes me mad, his prose actually bores into your skull, it feels like torture to read and you want to say enough, yes, I will tell you anything you want to hear, but please just shut the blank up
0	Dragging out the same joke for far too long. Swartzwelder is the best writer on the Simpsons staff, bar none. But his prose style leaves so much to be desired. What works within the context of a voiced animated show falls flat on its face in print.Swartzwelder revisits the character of Frank Burly, P.I., last seen in "The Time Machine Did It". That earlier novel worked, even though the joke got a litle long-in-the-tooth at the end. Here, the attempt to once again meld film-noirish black-and-white movie cliches with 50s-ish science fiction, this time an alien invasion that only Burly is too stupid to realize is happening, cannot even elicit a guffaw.Some may feel Burly is simply Homer recast as Phillip Marlowe. But even Homer would remember to be, you know...funny. In this case, the formula very quickly becomes. Burly almost discovers invasion, incident causes Burly great pain, Burly forgets there is an invasion. It just does not hold up.Maybe those who read this book without reading its predeccesor will enjoy it more as they will be unfamiliar with the formula. For those who are attracted purely by the "writer of the Simpsons" blurb, you're better off buying any of the DVDs and passing on this.
0	Disappointing. I had very high hopes for this book due to its title and was looking for how to more cohesively merge Buddhism with management in modern corporate America. My experience is that this book neither explained Buddhism correctly nor did it give good management principles. It was just some light reading and common sense. The meditation exercises at the end of the book were strange discussing different colors of light and using the four elements in meditation all that is needed is to focus on the breathe and observe thoughts without losing yourself in them, that is true meditation, simply sit. This book also focused to much time and effort on the self,which is the very thing we should be overcoming. This is a poor book on Buddhism and management.Keep Looking.
0	Old concepts repackaged and regurgitated. All Covey is saying in his longwinded book, basically, is this: Listen to the people you love. Put the family first in all your decisions. Blah blah blah and something about synergy.The writing is horrible, and the metaphors are overused. I also dislike Covey's plagiarizing material from the Bible and not acknowledging where he gets his "inspiration".  In one passage he equates the Bible and other books of scripture with "Chicken Soup For the Soul" as "wisdom literature".  Despite being a supposed devout Mormon himself, obviously he's afraid to mention the Book of Mormon in that passage. Perhaps he's afraid of scaring away potential pigeons--I mean, readers.This was a book my book club decided to read; otherwise I'd have never even tried to get past the first few pages. I wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give "us", the poor ignorant masses, advice on our own families. In one passage he even says that other people's advice may not apply to our own situations. Then how can he expect us to take his advice?Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library. Covey doesn't need your money, he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool. He's doing fine.
0	Historically inaccurate garbage. This book gets one star because you can't give zero. I have a B.A. in European History and I am utterly horrified by the historical inaccuracies in this series. As examples taken at random (there are lots, lots more of them): in Book One, Bauer describes Alcibiades as betraying Athens and leading an army into the city. Utterly incorrect. She admits she moved Boudicca's revolt until a later date in order to show that the Roman Empire was breaking down. Hello, you can't move historic dates in order to "prove" a hypothesis. In book Two, in her description of Justinian's rise to Emperor she basically says that he left the farm, studied hard and was chosen emperor. In point of fact, his uncle was emperor. Her historical errors go on and on. The author evidently didn't even bother to check her "facts" against something as simple as wikipedia. Bauer, according to her cover blurb, is a novelist and journalist with no apparent academic training in history, and, boy, does that lack of academic training show. She writes appealing journalistic hyperbole but doesn't bother to back her breezy simplifications with historical facts. Bauer also has a strong religous agenda. I'm a Christian myself but find the presentation of bible stories as historical events offensive. Anyone using this book to teach history to their child is doing their child a vast disservice.
0	This is only a VERY SHORT EXCERPT!!!!. This is misleading...not even 5% of the Ruskin masterwork is printed in this book.
0	Illegal surgery and the medical community. The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up

0	This book is trash. If you want a book about jarring, hideous color combinations and no useful information whatsoever, get this one. There are so many bad art instruction books, and this one is one of the worst & most useless. The cover of the book gives you an example of the horrible color schemes the author uses. Do you really want to make paintings like that? Also, the color theory in this book is WRONG. Quiller is one of those who still believes that the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow, when they are actually cyan, magenta, and yellow. I bought another book, "Color Theory Made Easy," which is much better. It teaches correct color theory and useful information. I don't know what other good color theory books there are, but I do know you shouldn't buy this useless piece of junk by Quiller. I am really tired of bad art instruction books getting rave reviews on Amazon.com and buying them because I was gullible enough to believe all these reviews
0	NOT for beginners or the mildly apathetic. This book is very comprehensive, which is either a blessing or curse depending on your background. As someone who knew nothing about Islam prior to reading this book, I was frequently overwhelmed by the mass of information that Lapidus has arranged. As you may notice by the sheer volume of this 970 page book, it is VERY wordy. Like most history texts, it is also very dry and devoid of emotion. The author does, however, provide a complex view of Islam that is fair and accurate
0	I was "Bored of the Silent". I feel I must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless, suspenseless, bore.  Being a fan of all things Egypt and an Agatha Christie fan as well I thought this book would be sure to please---not so!  Short of Grisham I've never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful, charming, intelligent, desirable, and perfect in any way and SO boring.  Was this a mystery?  I don't remember much of a plot at all.  Just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts.  Finally, why set it in Egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country, its people (other than a few trite stereotypes), and its antiquities?Reading it on a long plane flight, I actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable.  For my guilty pleasure I'll go back to Stephen King---Tolstoy by comparison
0	Too Blue. I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: "sophistication"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s.
0	Go to 'baye.com', and scroll to the training article on Power Factor Training. Yes, you can use more weight in positions of leverage advantage, not because you're working 'more muscle', but because of your limbs' positioning relative to gravity. When you finish a set of full-range  leg presses,(for example), you almost surely have strength left to do much more work in your somewhat straight-legged position. Does this mean that you should not work the weaker,  bend-legged position at all, as this book claims?  ////NO//// First of all, working the'weak range' to exhaustion is as effective as working the 'strong range',(it's how hard you work that matters in either case). Second, with the huge majority of people , the range you work is the only range that shows improvement, (I know, the author disagrees; he lies). Third, this almost-isometric style effects the central nervous system more than tissue.  If you only need strength in this one range, and don't want to change your appearance much, fine. But there's a problem even with that: Strength built without building tissue needs more maintenance than strength built along with  muscle, and is -so- specific to the mode of development as to be virtually useless in any other activity except the exercise that developed it! If you want to make proper use of this principle, try this: First work full-range reps until failure.Then, and only then, have the bar or machine arm assisted into 'strong range', and do a second set. This method requires much recuperation , and should only be done with one exercise in a session,(actually it's rarely needed at all, but certainly more valid than Power Factor.  The funny thing about Power Factor claims is that , if they want to mislead people with exercise principles, they haven't even chosen the most severe principle: You can -lower- more weight than you can -hold-. The best single way to develop strength is to have  a weight,(so heavy that you can't even hold it up!), assisted into the 'finished' position, and attempt to slow it's 'fall' as much as possible. Sure, it's crazy, dangerous, and unnecessary, but it works, (and it's full-range!)
0	Please find another Calculus book!. Let me put it bluntly: my instructor uses this book as little as possible due to the incredibly overdone style in which the text and problems are written. Calculus is difficult enough as it is, but this book makes it virtually impossible to comprehend. User un-friendly. Petition your math department to choose another text.

0	incredible fabrications of history. Does she know anything about Japan's wartime history? Just google "Unit 731," the place where her own daddy probably worked at. Is it a pure coincidence that her daddy lived in the area where these despicable, inhuman experiments took place
0	Worst Humorous book.. This is a worst book I ever read. Also it is not written by Jerry Seinfeld but forwarded by him. And I picked it up because of Seinfelds name. This book lacks humor. Its no way at the level of Larry Davids or Costanzas character. The chapters are just repetetive. Crappy letters and stories can be very humorous, but that humour is completely lacking in this book. I am giving it a 1 star because that is the lowest I can go. Avoid this. It is a waste of time. Broth must try a bit hard for his next publication. Seinfeld shows that he can be a loyal friend by giving a forward to this book, I guess, without reading it
0	The writing never really comes together... This is a collection of short stories revolving around the new founder of her own detective agency.  The book spends a fair amount of time on local color.  The mysteries, if you can call them that, are light weight.  There's nothing wrong with any of that, often I want a light read, but there were two big factors that I could not get around that make me give a one star rating.First, the people in Botswana are presented very negatively, and the men are even worse than the women.  Maybe most Botswanans truly are self-centered bastards, but I found that too hard to believe.  (Even so, I could accept that depiction in a hard-boiled detective book, but this is more of a sunny-side-up book.)Second, the author keeps presenting contradictory pictures of the characters, particularly the main character.  In one story she is shown as exceptionally honest, while most other stories show her freely lying.  In one story she says she would never commit a crime, and in another story she steals a car.  In one story she is attracted to a man who beats and rapes her, in some stories she has no interest in any man, and in one story she is attracted to an apparently nice man.  I kept asking myself if the author was trying to make some point by these contradictions, but I couldn't discern any theme and came to believe it was simply poor writing
0	Lackluster. This book was very easy to read and moved along quickly but it was by no means &quot;good.&quot;  The plot was sometimes boring and sometimes just silly and the writing was banal.  Although it was a fast read, there are  hundreds of other books out there that are a fast read and capitivating.   Reading this book was a waste of my time
0	TOO DARK FOR ME. I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKA
0	Poor. The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many.
0	Not-so-Perfect Life is far from perfect book. I laughed out loud when I read Annie Lamont's "Operating Instructions", but I understood the source when I read it.  I am very disappointed in Fox's book because she passes herself off as a "suburban educated mom" who is struggling with role definition.  The book is whiney to a fault, and Fox is not the typical educated professional with whom I can relate. In the first 50 pages I had difficulty getting past her foray into witchcraft and active participation in the pro-abortion movement.  At least one of these, if not both, are huge mis-connects for the "average" person, much less, the market for which the book was supposedly written.  Skip this and read Lamont.
0	Islam in America. Read The Holy Quran before reading any propaganda books like this. Any book on Islam not written by a Islamic Scholar will be biased and racist. The wisdom of the Islamic Faith can only be understood by understanding the life of the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). The Hadith will guide you in understanding the true path for all mankind. Please do not buy propaganda books. Go to the sourse of all Islamic thought. Read the Koran and the Hadith and understand the truth without lies from American Press
0	Boring. I know it's difficult to discuss and review all of Europe in one book, but this book was boring. It was easy to read, but not very fun or interesting. It did hit the highlights of the major sights, but it acts more like a reference than an exciting guide
0	Didn't work for me... This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead..
0	if you have any sort of hard science knowledge, don't bother. this book is obviously written by someone who is scientifically-challenged.  basic astronomy, math, ecology, etc., do not add up.    ----------------------------   this is especially unfortunate, since the characters were created so well.  they were people who were real - complex mixtures of strengths, weaknesses, inconsistancies, virtues, stupidites, etc.  in fact, the characters and basic story were so well done, that i pushed on in the book much further than i should have, hoping that bad science would go away and i could enjoy the interaction of the people, but alas, after a hundred or so pages, i could take it no longer
0	BoRiNg!. Bought because it's purportedly a 'MUST READ' of recommended English 19th century literature and I'm trying to read every good book I can before I die (hopefully at 90). Unfortunately,  this book is a waste of time as it's BoRiNg (even w/ the footnotes that I so dearly love).
0	Trotsky: Mass Murderer and Liar. You know, I hate to burst the bubble of devoted Trotskyites across the globe, but Trotsky was just as responsible for Stalin's rule as anyone. For Leon to blame Stalin is the height of hypocrisy. Without Lenin's apparatus of social repression and Trotsky's apparatus of military dictatorship, Stalin would never have been.The Russian Revolution was never a win for workers. It destroyed them, some 4 million at Lenin's hands, 30 million by Stalin, and 65 million by Mao Tse-tung.No policy or ideology that denies the soul can ever succeed. And communism does just that. By denying that which makes humans humans, it can bring only suffering
0	Disappointing. McLaren's critique of the church in the modern age paints a scathing picture, but doesn't refer to any leaders by name. His perspective seems distorted to me, but I cannot tell who he has in mind, because he doesn't cite any particular modern church writings.Of most concern to me is that McLaren's strategies seem to lack biblical support.  Culture seems to be the guiding force behind his strategies, but he is working from his own projection of the direction of western culture in the future.  If McLaren's projection is off, then his strategies will be irrelevant at best.
0	Potentially Very Dangerous. This is the story of a very arrogant doctor who quits his medical practice because of what his &quot;Inner Teacher&quot; told him. This could be a sign of psychosis. Nowhere in the books is the distinction between psychosis and psychic ever made. Perhaps Joy does not want his readers and potential students to know the difference
0	Alien Abductions and hypnotic induced memories.. This book is a text book case of hypnotically induced memories for the sake of UFO disinformation, I will give three star in other subject :MIND CONTROL.The only "aliens" who really want to  take samples of your tissue have your same DNA and wear camuflage uniforms...don't waste your money with this one
0	Nice But I expected More. This is a nice book but not a good buy at about $50! Nice pictures that you might look at again sometime in the future but not much info if you want a reference for Yoga.What is needed in the Yoga community is a book like "Strength Training Anatomy"  By Frederic Delavier.( at about $15 this is THE BOOK to have in your collection!!) Detailing Yoga asanas that work the various muscle groups.
0	not so hot. The cover is by far the best art in this book...  There are some other good ones inside, but most are incredibly poorly drawn and not very erotic at all; why they bothered putting a hard cover on such an amateurish effort is beyond me.  Even the ones that are well drawn mostly just look like normal women with wings added as an afterthought.  Bottom line, I'll snip out a few pictures to keep as art reference and throw away the rest.
0	Blank Pages and Redundant Material. I received this book as a gift, and I am so glad I did not buy it.  It is a 137 page book, of which over 50 pages (FIFTY PAGES) are blank, or have bad line-art of a siamese cat.  The remaining pages are large type, double spaced, half of which are just rehashes of previous books.  I figure there are probably 30 pages of original material.  It's obvious that Ms. Braun (or the publishers using a ghostwriter) are just trying to milk the fan base for more money.  Avoid this book, even if you are a Cat Who completist
0	Uninformed.  A book of generalizations for his cult. I've been confused by Michael Medved's position on film ever sinse he posed a question in the wall Street Journal asking "What happened to the missing moviegoers?".  He was speaking about the end of the Production Code (censorship) in Hollywood, and how that coincided with a drop off in movie attendance.Yes--movies seriously changed in the late 60s, as filmmakers were allowed to depict subject matter previously forbidden.  I'm not sure what he is trying to prove here.  Everyone stopped going to the movies because of this?  So, it had nothing to do with attendance dropping since the mid-50s, with Vietnam, with the death of urban movie palaces and the total change of the movie going experience, the public's boredom with overblown "roadshow attractions" , with television?No, actually, because in Mr. Medved's world you can trace anything and everything to a lack of morals.He points out that the "Sound of Music" won best Picture in 1965, and then "Midnight Cowboy" (about a male hustler) won Best picture in 1969, thereby proving the decline and fall of western civilization.So, I guess nevermind how many "family" movies of this time period ("Hello Dolly," "Doctor Dolittle", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," "Greatest Story Ever Told") were total and complete bombs at the box office.He states that removal of the production code (remember, the decline and fall of western civilization) "hurt the bottom line." And apparently movies have just been utter "filth" ever since?So, Christians would be hypocritical to own DVDs of the films that came out just after the removal of the Code, that could not have been made before it: "The Wild Bunch," "The Grauduate," "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," "The Producers," "Rosemary's Baby," "Midnight Cowboy," "Bonnie and Clyde."All of those movies did great at the box office, by the way.So I'm lost as to how the removal of the Production Code wrecked "the bottom line" in Hollywood.Oh yes, one other thing:  Michael Medved did the glowing introduction to DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" at the Conservative Film Festival (or whatever its called) in 2004.DeMille's 1932 film "The Sign of The Cross," jam-packed with violence, sexual perversion, [...]), helped contribute to the Catholic revolt against films, and the enforcement of the Code itself.Some "scholar" you guys got here.
0	No solos. If you are trying to learn the solos of the first four Iron Maiden albums (S/T, Killers, Number of the Beast, and Piece of Mind), this is not the book for you. This book only has the rhythm guitar.
0	lots of drawings, but little info. This booklet has a lot of Warner Brothers drawings, but it doesn't delve into the specifics of creating animation very well.  I'd recommend getting The Animator's Survival Kit instead as it has tons of good and well explained info on the art of creating your own animation
0	disappointed. The original works of James Strong are excellent, however in the case of some of these newer books where Dr. Strong's work has been "corrected" are not so good. Corrected means shot full of errors. For example, I understand that many believe in the rapture, however the word rapture does not exist in the Bible, it is a work of man. I was so disappointed to see references to rapture in a bible dictionary because belief in the rapture alters the entire understanding of the New Testament. If I were given the option I would have given it a 0
0	Misses the Point. After using Dr.Dyer's aaah meditation CD for a month, I decided that I wanted to learn more this meditation. Therefore, I bought the book Manifest Your Destiny.  The book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism.  There are many things that disturb me about this book.Dr. Dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book, chapter, or verse.  One of the bible quotes he uses is "Is it not written in your law `I have said, You are gods?'" (John 10:34)  This is the passage to which Jesus referred when He said this to the Pharisees who were attempting to charge Him with blasphemy: " God standeth in the congregation of God; He judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, And respect the persons of the wicked? ... I said, Ye are gods, And all of you sons of the Most High."  (Psalms 82:1,2,6). The unjust judges of Israel (i.e., the Pharisees) were the subject of these verses.  They were civil magistrates because of their authority and power; and, they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Dr. Dyer uses this verse completely out of context.   Scripture cannot be broken.Jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are God's other laws.  A true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure God's Word for his own purpose.  Neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about God's Word and actually expect to know God's and come into a relationship with Him.  Dr. Dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism. The fact of the matter is that according to Jesus the door to God's kingdom is narrow (Luke 13:24).   There are no shortcuts.Lastly, a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions.  This appears to be a main theme of Dr. Dyer's book.  Those who seek God first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a "gift" from Him.  We do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust God and put Him first in our lives.  Dr. Dyer seems to miss the point.
0	No dept. I expected something of a mystery with plot development. Wow, the plot never got higher than 6&quot;s off the ground. The story was weak without any mystery and it had no development of charaters. The dialogue seemed to be at a 6th grade level because the story's character seemed to behave as 6th graders. If you read, Ludlum, Clancy, DeMille, Follet don't spend time opening this book. For those reviewers who thought this book had great insights into behind the scenes work of the government, you need to expand your reading list. The idea of the purple dots could have been a great story, but it never got off the launch pad. Most people have more excitement driving to work than what this story provided
0	Please Do Not Be Mislead By The Title!. If you're interested primarily in Near-Death Experiences, then do not go with this one.  Mrs. Whitfield describes her two NDE's here, but this is for the most part a New Age compendium on how to increase your spirituality through the balancing of your chakras, handling psychic and kundalini  energies, etc.  There's nothing wrong with that except for perhaps  misleading the public with the title such as it is.  Mrs. Whitfield is an  accomplished therapist and extemely well-studied in her work, but there are  too many publications available like this one.  For those wanting powerful  testimonials from those who have had near-death experiences, you will NOT  find it here. There are so many more books available from Amazon that carry  NDE accounts that will change your life
0	Why continue to be deceived... Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)
0	The Pursuit of Arrogance. Simply put, this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself. It's like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical, drunken uncle. "Blah blah blah... And then  I saved the world and looked good doing it.... Blah blah blah... AREN'T I GREAT?!?!
0	Ramblings of a dirty old man. Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead
0	A mediocre look at French Style. I bought this book expecting it to be as wonderful as French Chic by fashion writer Suzanne Somer (unfortunately out of print) or A Year of Style by Frederic Fekkai.  Unfortunately, this book is filled with dated clothing and very little substance to explain the French fashion mystique.  However, there are two other great books that are keepers.  The first is Frederic Fekkai: A Year of Style.  The famous French stylist does an excellent job of showing you how to be beautiful with easy and simple ideas to use throughout the year. The second book is A Guide to Elegance: For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on All Occasions by Geneviere Antonine Dariaux.  Madame Genevieve Antoine Dariaux, former directrice for Nina Ricci shares her extensive expertise on creating the classic French look
0	Promise lost. The title is misleading. It should indicate that a great deal of other information is brought into play, such as history, politics, and propoganda. Many will, no doubt, make the case for how these add information to the main story line. I don't see how a flawed and simplistic history of early research in radiation helps tell the story of how a boy becomes interested in building a reactor. If you want to read a better and more correct history of the discovery and early work in radiation, even an encyclopedia does a better job. And the author's drive to paint nuclear energy as black as possible leads him to huge errors in his facts. What Wernher von Braun has to do with radiation, I can't begin to guess, but he was never a major in the SS. He was never an officer in any Nazi organization. Some reviewers dispute the author's aim to attack nuclear energy. It's very telling that one of his oft quoted sources, "Nukespeak" was published by the Sierra Club and written by a trio who have made it public that their aim is to be sure this country turns permanently away from this energy source. The author's significant mistakes are enough to discredit this book on their own merit, or lack of.I feel a need to also address his characterization of David and other geeks. Especially in lack of a mentor or proper guidance with potentially lethal equipment, an enthusiastic student shouldn't be run down by adults. That, as much as any other event in David's life, helped push him further into the hole he was digging, withdrawing from possible assistance, and causing David to adopt a suspicious and sarcastic attitude toward adults. That's a certain recipe for the disaster that nearly was in David's life. I do know of that which I speak. My own experiments when I was younger nearly disposed of me, and the abuse I took from peers and adults only made me more determined to show them I knew what I was doing. I secreted all I did, as David began to do. We dorks may be dorks, but alienating eccentrics doesn't help them or those affected by them.A disappointing book, one that could have risen to great heights. The bigger shame is that there is no other book on the subject that I can recommend
0	Don't Quit Your Dayjob!. Maybe the worst "thriller" I've read in years. The dialogue, characters and plot are at best soap opera material and that's giving it a positive spin. I hope Mr. Hosp is a good lawyer....and we all know what Wm. Shakespeare said about that profession
0	More money?. Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.
0	A Little Voice Says "Don't Waste Your Money". The main thing I learnt from this book is that it is definitely better sometimes to look through a book before buying it. I thought this was a very juvenile book, in terms of the level of smearing and name calling I thought there was, e.g. the False Memory Syndrome Foundation is described as "the CIA's answer to the flat earth society"and Col John Alexander is given the epithet "Doctor of Death". Some child abuse cases are recounted with an unnecessary level of graphic detail, and the author includes a partially obscured picture of a scene of child pornography. I wondered if this was really needed, but then I remembered that the publisher is Feral House, which also publishes books by Satanist Anton LaVey and the Apocalypse Culture books, which also feature child porn. Instead of blaming the CIA for everything, Mr Constantine could also have pointed the finger at his publisher for potentially encouraging Satanism and child abuse.I don't really want to spend more time saying what I didn't like about this book, but I didn't like the way the author seemed to be so sure of himself. Some examples: all UFOs are manmade, all "alien" abductions are CIA abductions, remote viewing is the CIA beaming images into people's heads.
0	Houston...we have a problem. I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world
0	Sisler: One of the two most overrated players ever. I hope Huhn did not spend much time on this project.George Sisler had a .340 career batting average, and that sounds impressive to the few baseball fans who still think batting average is a major statistic.  But for the rest of us, Sisler is either--as the preeminent living baseball historian, Bill James, calls him--the most overrated player in baseball history, or, as I call him, the second most overrated player in baseball history, behind Roberto Clemente.The two men had the same problem.  They racked up very high batting averages for their eras, and thus superficially appeared to be great hitters, but they almost never walked.  Thus, their career ON-BASE PERCENTAGES, of which "batting average" is but a portion, were mediocre.  And neither one of them hit home runs, though Sisler was especially egregious in this respect.He played in one of baseball's greatest launching pads ever,  Sportsman's Park, where it was: 310 down the right field line, 322 to straightaway right, and 351 to deepest right center.  And he played there with the super-live ball of the 1920's, before they put the screen up in that part of the park.  He also got to play as a visitor in Cleveland's League Park and NY's Yankee Stadium, when they were generous to left-handed hitters, as well as nearly three full seasons as a visitor in the outrageous Baker Bowl in Philly, the century's greatest launching pad.Do you know how many HR's the guy hit in his career?  Try 102.So this guy is not "baseball's forgotten great."  This guy is deservedly forgotten, because sophisticated baseball fans have come to realize he wasn't great.  All those years in Sportsman's Park, and he never once hit 20 HR's.  All those gaudy batting averages, and his career on-base percentage was lower than those of Fred McGriff, Alvin Davis, Gene Tenace, Elmer Valo, Jack Clark and many scores of other guys who hit nowhere near .300, let alone .340.Finally, I'm aware of Sisler's mid-career injury, and the huge decline in his stats which flowed from it.  He was a vastly better player before that than afterward, and without it, he may have been truly great.  But so what?  Anyone remember Don Mattingly?  I remember thinking he was going to replace Lou Gehrig as the greatest 1B of all time.  And I wasn't alone.  His back injury ruined him, and if he still makes the Hall, it will be only because he was a Yankee.  These things happen, and they don't make Sisler something he was not.  (And Sisler was just as terrible about taking walks before the injury as after.)Next time, Mr. Huhn, write about a "forgotten great" who truly was great.  This book was a waste of your time, and is a waste of any reader's time.Jim F
0	YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. Obviously, creationists confuse the question "Has evolution occurred?" with the question "What is the cause of evolution?" The scientific answer to the first question is, of course, "yes," and the answer to the second question (at least in part) is "natural selection." What logic and evidence leads scientists to these answers?The Logic Of EvolutionThe conclusion that evolution has occurred is drawn from two simple observations:Observation 1: Living things come only from living things. Spontaneous generation is not possible when living things are already in existence.Observation 2: Fossil remains show that living things in the remote past were very different from living things today.THEREFORE:Conclusion: Life has changed through time (evolved).A dramatic proof of the thesis that life has changed through time is seen in the fossil record of the vertebrates, animals having a segmented backbone. At the beginning of the Cambrian Period (570-500 million years ago), there were no vertebrates at all. Later in the Cambrian, problematic forms appeared which seem to have been related to the vertebrates, but showed distant affinities with the echinoderms as well. (Echinoderms today are represented by starfish, sea lilies, sea cucumbers, etc.; embryologically they appear to compose the phylum most closely related to the Chordata, the phylum to which vertebrates belong.) Toward the end of the Cambrian Period, the first vertebrates appeared: the ostracoderms, jawless fishes possessed of a bony armor plate and having flattened bodies apparently adapted to a bottom-feeding way of life.According to the fossil record, vertebrates went without jaws for many millions of years. Finally, at the beginning of the Devonian Period (395-345 million years ago), the first fish with jaws entered their remains into the record in the rocks. At the very end of the Devonian or the beginning of the Carboniferous Period (345-280 million years ago), the first primitive amphibians arose. These fish-like animals differed from their air-breathing fish ancestors mostly in their elaboration of the bony structure of the paired appendages - converting fins into hands and feet - and in reinforcement of the structures attaching the paired appendages to the spinal column. The first reptiles did not appear until the last half of the Carboniferous Period.To give the lie to creationist claims that there are no connecting-link fossils to join the vertebrate classes, the Permian Period (280-225 million years ago) saw the appearance of an entire order of animals, the mammal-like reptiles (Therapsida), which can be seen to change with time from typical, primitive reptiles, into primitive mammals. It was not until late in the Triassic Period (225-190 million years ago) that the therapsid-mammal transmutation was complete. Contrary to the first chapter of Genesis, which claims that the first mammals appeared on the earth a mere twenty-four hours after the first fish, the first mammals did not appear on earth until more than 300 million years of fish evolution had transpired!Birds, which, according to both creation myths in Genesis, were created on the same day as fish, do not enter the fossil record until the Jurassic Period (190-136 million years ago). Representing an ultimate variation on the dinosaur theme, birds trace their descent from reptiles quite different from those ancestral to the mammals. Contrary to the claims of some creationists, evolutionists do not claim that reptiles evolved into birds, and birds evolved into mammals!Even though the first mammals appeared in the Triassic Period, forms for which the English language has names would not appear until the late Cretaceous (136-65 million years ago), when opossum-like forms appeared, the Eocene Epoch (60-40 million years ago), when primitive whales originated, and the Oligocene Epoch (40-25 million years ago), when apes, monkeys, and primitive grazing mammals appeared.The record in the rocks, thus, is evidence either for fishes evolving into birds and mammals, or it is evidence of thousands of successive "special creations" - magical replacements of successive faunas by slightly different ones. Curiously, the latter interpretation is as unbiblical as it is unscientific.If either of the biblical myths were true, all types of vertebrates - living types of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes - would be found along with bacteria and trilobites at the very beginning of the fossil record and would be extractable from all rock layers of later ages. But of course, nothing could be farther from reality. The infamous "gaps in the fossil record," adduced by creationists as evidence against evolution, are actually a devastating refutation of the idea that all forms of life were miraculously zapped onto the earth at the same time!The Logic Of Natural SelectionSince creationists in their attacks of evolution in general, and of natural selection in particular, usually obfuscate the scientific principles involved and generally substitute a straw man which is easier to ridicule, it is important that we state clearly just what it is that science has to say on the topic of how new species come to be. The modern ("synthetic") theory of natural selection consists of a tightly interwoven fabric of observations and logical conclusions drawn from them. In a nutshell, the structure of the theory is the following:Observation 1: All living things tend to reproduce in geometric progression, so that if all offspring survived, the entire earth would be overrun by them.Observation 2: In fact, however, the earth is NOT so overrun. The populations of various species remain approximately constant in size from century to century, due to the finite resources of the environment.THEREFORE:Conclusion A: There must be a competition for the available resources of the environment, a "struggle for existence."Observation 3: Heritable variations (mutations) are observed to occur spontaneously, from time to time, in populations of all species.Observation 4: In a given environment, some of these variations are helpful in the struggle for existence, and others are harmful or neutral.THEREFORE:Conclusion B: A natural selection of individuals will result. Those with helpful mutations will survive and expand in numbers, and those with harmful mutations will tend to perish and be reduced in numbers.Observation 5: The source of inheritable changes is either (1) change in the sequence of chemical "bases" in the DNA molecules making up an organism's genes, (2) rearrangement of genes on chromosomes, or (3) multiplication or deletion of genes or chromosomes.Observation 6: Physically and chemically speaking, there is no limit to the amount of base changing possible in DNA or the amount of gene rearrangement which can take place.THEREFORE:Conclusion C: There will be no limit to the amount of variation possible in any given species. Given enough time, and changing environmental conditions, mutation will add to mutation, and any species will gradually change into one or more new species. As mutations cause greater and greater cumulative change, and as sexual recombination assembles novel hereditary ensembles, species will turn into new genera, genera into new families, etc.With the exception of the observations concerning changes in DNA and chromosomes as the source of evolutionary variation, the theory above was discovered by Charles Darwin in the middle of the last century. Darwin came to his theory grudgingly - he had originally been a creationist himself. But the facts of nature which he uncovered in his trip around the world on H.M.S. Beagle forced him to give up the Genesis mythology in favor of evolutionary science, and made him formulate the theory of natural selection.It is not often remembered that Darwin was not the only person to discover the principle of natural selection. At the same time that Darwin was formulating his theory, Alfred Russell Wallace - completely independent of Darwin, and half a world away - was forced by his study of the plants and animals of the Malay Archipelago to conclude that evolution had occurred, and that natural selection was the motive force!The lesson to be learned from this is that the facts of nature compel unbiased minds to conclude that evolution has occurred, and that natural selection is at least a part of the cause of evolutionary change. (Population size and genetic isolation of populations are also important factors affecting the degree to which evolutionary change will occur.)As we examine the bizarre details of the Genesis creation myth, however, we must ask: Is it conceivable that any person not already aware of the first Genesis myth could go out into the world of nature and conclude that green plants came into existence before the sun? That birds existed before reptiles? Without knowledge of the second Genesis myth, who would come up with the idea that man is older than both plants and animals, but that woman did not come into existence until the last animal species had appeared? Without being brainwashed by the Noah's Ark tale, what geologist would conclude that the whole planet was covered by a shell of water 4,334 years ago? What independent observer would conclude that the kiwi, which can neither swim nor fly, came to New Zealand from Mt. Ararat in Turkey, but couldn't make it to Greece or Australia? Could anyone conclude that there was once a "firmament" in the sky -- with windows in it, and water above it?Of course not. But we can be quite sure that even if the creationist legions of darkness should succeed in eradicating all knowledge of Darwin's theory, honest men and women of the future studying the facts of nature would discover it anew. This is because evolutionary science is science, and is true in the sense that it is testable and accords with the facts of nature. The creationist dogmas, however, are not science and - to the extent that they are testable - are contradicted by the testimony of nature.
0	Dont waste your time or money. Terrible and pretentious writing. I tried to read this book without much luck. If you have trouble sleeping, this is the perfect sleeping pill.
0	My Baby is a PERSON, Not a Thing. While this book does contain good information, it's presented in a way I couldn't get past. In an attempt to read like the owner's manual for a machine, like a car or a stereo system, the book consistently refers to the baby as "the model". It was obviously meant to be cute but in my opinion it fails in that respect. I'm very much turned off by referring to babies in the same way you would refer to your washing machine. My baby is a PERSON, not a THING. To its credit, the book does explain how each baby is unique, but it does so by pointing out that "some models do this" and "some models do that." Again, I'm turned off by referring to the baby as a "model"
0	How Sad............ I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up......
0	Left me wanting more... The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money
0	Wasted My Money. The title was the best part of this book.  Not worth purchasing - if you MUST read it check it out from the library or borrow it. Don't ask me for it - mine is headed for Goodwill because I can not stand to burn or trash a book. It was awful and vulgar.  Very disappointed. I hope someone else writes the book to fit the title.  Unfortunately I bought two books by the author and was disappointed with BOTH

Therefore when I had gone on this diet I actually put on some weight and realized that I don't miss the getting tired eating so much bread.I'm sure it'll work for some but wasn't right for me
0	Tedious. Reminded me of a UT student on the 7 year plan. A great 200 page story that is told in 380 pages. Hope the next is better
0	Ok but not very detailed. This book is a more a of brief review of table saw technique and jigs. The chapters are not very detailed and don't actually contain any directions for doing most of cuts or processes. The most frustrating thing is where he will say "just use this very handy jig" and then gives a very crude drawing of the jig with no explanation of how to build it or even a basic layout. A MUCH better book is Kelly Mehler's The Table Saw Book
0	Terrible Book. Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author
0	Econometrics Analysis by William H. Greene. I used the first edition of this book as a graduate student in my econometrics class. The book is very confusing and hard to understand. It's still of no help to me now that I am a professor and writing research paper. Whenever I need a review in econometrics I use Judge et all; &quot;The Theory and practice of econometrics.&quot; It is a better book, well written, and easy to follow. Unfortunately it is off print. We need a better book than the one by Greene. If it was for me, this book should be put where it belongs, in the garbage
0	Shallow content, Overpriced book. This book has a very shallow content, and is only a glorified feature listing of web analytics product features with no in-depth details at all. What makes it worse is it is highly overpriced for what shallow content it offers. This information can be obtained from the vendors website datasheets also. Avoid this book
0	aes sedai are sooo boring. the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author
0	For tru-fans only. The novel was a badly-researched and badly-written third-rate airport thriller.  This illustrated edition is an expensive and attractive badly-researched and badly-written third-rate airport thriller.For tru-fans only
0	how bad can you get with good ideas?. Of the first three Anita Blake's novels this is surely the worst.This hit me as totally unexpected and I am very disappointed.The problem lies in the plot, misconstructed, discontinuous, a heap of unrelated events thrown together with little sense, not to mention a mass of inconsistencies spread throughout the pages. Inconsistencies in characters descriptions and details are to be found in all the first four books but here we have mistakes such as Anita driving her car which was wrecked the night before and is again the day after. Hard to swallow.In such a context that some ideas are really good and some characters very interesting matters very little
0	The Essence Of Awful. Thomas Frank has been endowed with a talent for writing tortured prose which is uniquely inelegant, the Washington Post should really recruit him, he could be much more effective at crippling the language there. Instead he makes do with whatever scraps of intellect he possess to write articles in  obscure magazines one stumbles over occasionally in second hand bookstores,  and this wretchedness.  Thomas Frank is no more equipped to comment on the  Sixties then Michael Crichton would be on Bertrand Russel
0	Boots. The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.Drop ya boots, dawg!!!I
0	The really own words of the master are excellent. One at the front: The really own words of the master are excellent. One must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with Bruce Lee. The rest consists of interviews with the former  interviewers. However, as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune.  But the words of the master are absolutely worth-while, as already  mentioned at the beginning
0	An attempted read. Perhaps I expected more from this book than was present, but I could hardly get through the first few chapters and I am an avid historic biography reader. I found her methods tiresome and boring, having the preference to recite found facts rather than compile and share, she reads like a card catalog. I now know exactly what to read if I do wish to learn something of these women she eludes to, but after having put this book down, I feel I am less wise to the subjects then when I started. I need a chronological telling of a person and their movement, not a forty-three page explanation of exactly who has written such things in the past. Perhaps, I stopped reading three or four chapters before it got good, but I doubt it. I was very disappointed
0	belief vs. belief; not science vs. religion. This book is written relatively well.  But, as other reviewers points out, if you really want to understand the arguments, then you had better realize Eugenie Scott is a staunch defender evolution and always has been.  In other words, there is no way she could have, and did not, write a balanced treatment of the debate at all.  It's balanced for evolutionists, to be sure, not for anyone else and obviously not for me.  I am still waiting for anyone, anyone at all, to go into enough detail about the fossil record (there are a number of possibilities here) to actually prove that there are enough fossils, that the dating of them was accurate, there was no 'fudging', and many more details about the fossils themselves and the techniques used to analyze them - to show that evolution is a fact.  If, for example, we somehow fossilized 100 different birds that are alive today, some related and some not, I have a feeling that evolution would still be prescribed as the cause for the different species, that different dates would be assigned for each species based on what type of rock it was found (even though it has nothing to do with anything in this case), etc.  The negative reviews of those who critize this book are based purely on emotion.  None of them involve science, which is supposedly what evolution is based on.  If anyone can tell me how specific traits of evolution are testable, such as the 'fact' that life began from inanimate matter, or that species evolved into separate species, I would love to hear it.  Please be specific and let me know how you know based on your five senses, and not that there's a magical theory that explains it, because just as creationism explains everything - so does evolution.  Both are not true.  I am truly amazed that Amazon.com doesn't delete most of the 'reviews' because they are nothing but a bunch of cheap shots at the other side
0	Not one to start with. Aaron Sisson works in the English mining industry, and is also a talented flortist. Disenchanted with his life, he leaves his wife and children and finds work with an orchestra in London. There, and in Italy, he tries to come to terms with his life and emotions whilst finding new acquaintances in London society and then with Britons in Italy.The novel centres on Aaron's alienation, his retreat from and aversion to responsibility for others: it is right to stay in a relationship when you are feeling untrue to yourself by doing so? Just what are individuals' responsibilities to each other?These are familiar Lawrence themes and will come as no surprise to those who have read his other works. It's also very much a novel of its time: pseudo-fascist ideas are in the air - social Darwinism and Nietzschean thought permeate the attitudes of the main characters, especially Lilly.That being said, this is somewhat second-rate Lawrence. It's a very bitty novel: it was written in haste, sections completed then left for a considerable amount of time. And it reads like that. Few of the characters are convincingly drawn, others appear then disappear without reason and without contributing to the novel in any meaningful way. The strength of the prose is variable, with large sections of the novel stagnating as a result.One for those interested in reading Lawrence's lesser-known works, but I should imagine a turn-off for those trying him out for the first time.G Rodger
0	Woeful. I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell.
0	Disappointing. I was really curious about Angela Davis,but I found this book really boring. It seemed really clinical and dry. I've read alot of autobiographies,and this one was really disappointing. She never really opened up
0	Hiro's Worst Book. I have read Dilip Hiro's other books, which I am a big fan of, and this one is terrible. It is totally biased against America. It seems that Hiro is questioning Bin Laden's and Al Qaeda's involvement in the 9/11 events. He also seems to have a soft spot in his heart for the Taleban regime, and defends them for not turning over Bin Laden to the US.The historical background he gives on the different nations and religion of the region is excellent and well written. When the book gets into the time of the 20th century and later, it seems that Hiro sides with the radicals, or makes excuses for their actions.America and the West are not perfect, and are part of the cycle of violence in the middle east, but to totally dicredit all of our policies and actions is rediculous. I do not recommend this book, unless you like Al Qaeda and the Taleban
0	A Conflicted Review. My review of this book is somewhat conflicted.  While I would state it would make a good book if you did not know anything about Windows 2000 Security, I find that it fails as a preparation for the 70-214 exam.I read some of the paragraph length sentences to others at work, and they too got a chuckle out of it.  The simplest of items are presented in a wordiness that would make reading Our Mutual Friend or even War and Peace akin to glancing through the Sunday comics.  At the same time, many items that should be the meat of the book are glossed over in an almost trivial manner.If this were simply a training manual, it would have received 3 or even 4 stars.  While Windows NT 4.0 Server can be considered archaic, not even a full page in this text is given to security concerns during the upgrade procedure from NT 4.0 to 2000.I would heartily suggest brushing up on upgrade issues for the exam if this book is to be your sole study guide.  With only 50 questions on the exam, it would not take many NT 4.0 questions to blow your chance at passing the 70-214 exam
0	Boring. I could not get into this book.  The storyline was dull and so were the characters.  Not recommended
0	A broad book, but lacking in details. The book covers a broad range of problems in machine design but lacks clear explanations and citations.  Often times in sample problems the author's solution skips crucial steps or fails to cite information.  The section on fasteners is lacking as well.  It neglects to mention counterfeit fasteners and their implications in recent years.  It also does not mention AN or NAS fasteners.  Too many coeficients are taken blindy from charts which are not cited.  This makes the problems in the book little more than blind "plug & chug" type problems.  One might expect this from a first or second edition high school book, but not a fourth edition college text
0	Beware:  Difficult Read. Perhaps this book explains Schopenhauer with amazing clarity and detail, but I couldn't make it past the first 50 pages.  It's just one multi-page paragraph after another.  The author needs to learn the concept of whitespace.The introduction to "Essays and Aphorisms" provides a concise look at Schopenhauer for the casual reader
0	get your nose out of your navel and see the world around you. This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator
0	That's It. Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers
0	Oreilly losing quality. This book as has been said "is a completely different book and not worthy of being called the second edition of such a good book". Oreilly has dissapointed me for the first time, since most oreilly perl books are excellent value and of a high quality. Instead as in the first edition that covers a good range of advanced topics this book chooses some rare and obscure ones. This book is of little use to the programmer whom has ever picked up the cook book or perl programming by same publisher. Unfortunely for me I did not have the chance to see the book in person, or a truthful review.
0	Not at all colorful or fun to read for parents or students. We have this book - in fact, we have had it for six years and have never used it.  I have tried, but it is too boring to use.  Poetry should be colorful and beautiful.  Not page after page of poetic text to read.  I suggest getting some classic poetry books - full of color and pictures - and reading the beautiful words to your children.  This book is one to skip
0	You do plan to have Chain Masters on your Chain Master Tour?. You gotta love a book called "Master of Chains" which deprives you of anything even remotely resembling a Master of Chains until the last 50 pages of text. Oh wait... no you don't. Lebow destroys the nice tapestries he managed to weave with decent dramatic prose by tripping through the worst action writing I've ever seen.As with most of the D&D novels: the editor assigned to this book is completely incompetent and has no business working in professional publishing.
0	The CD doesn't run on a Mac. I wish I could review the book but I can't. I have a Mac and can't run the CD. I have totally wasted my money.Almost every nursing book I've bought in the last two years has had a CD and every one of them has worked. I just went back through the description on Amazon and can't find a reference to the fact that you have to be running windows. So if you have a Mac stay away from this book
0	Fabrications. Helllo!  I am Mambo Racine Sans Bout, the same Mambo Racine about whom Ross Heaven has so many nice things to say in his book, "Vodou Shaman".  It is with some regret that I must warn the prospective reader that most of what is in this book never actually happened - Ross is willing to say anything for a buck, apparently.  He never let me see what he was writing until the book was published, and I never imagined he would make up so many stories!  Now that I have refused to support his activities he is very angry with me, but the fact remains that this book is 99% BUNK.  [...
0	I would never recommend. his biggest advice - a rooming house.  For one good luck finding a house that has proper zoning for this.  Politicians and neighborhoods hate these things.  Not to mention the nightmare of the transient types you will attract.  Also it's pretty dated as it still recommends buying RTC properties.  The RTC died out years ago after the aftermath of the 80's real estate and S&amp;L crash
0	Don't buy this book. I really hate to pan a book because I have a lot of respect for the effort that goes into writing one but do yourself a favor and skip this one.I purchased it based on the rave reviews below and then when I recieved it I knew immediatly that I had to return it. Illustrator Gone Wild is a sophmoric effort. At best it's worth flipping through while in the book store but it's not worth taking home. If you've bothered to learn Illustrator from a class or a good book, such as Adobe's Classroom in a book series, then you all ready have the skills and knowledge to do everything in the book such as the chapter on making Kiss type. (Which I doubt you'll ever be called upon to do) But if you want to learn something about the details of making clean professional or even attractive art then you'll find this book lacking, as I did.The key thing that interested me in the book was the promised chapter on photo-realism and the review that said this book was like the WoW series only more project oriented. The details on photo-realism were so scant that one could pick up all this book had to say in 30 minutes of trying to trace and color a shiny metal object. This book's similarity to the WoW series ends at being a book with chapters, words and pictures. While it does offer more detail in steps to create art than WoW the projects it offers are the kind of thing you'd do on a Sunday afternoon for fun or for a friend's band who can't afford to pay you but not the kind of thing you'd show at work, in a portfolio or try to sell freelance
0	Miller's Motive For Bad Reporting. This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales
0	Long-winded for such a thin volume... I would've loved to have this information more succinct & to the point, it would have made a good article...unfortunately the author obviously attempted to stretch it out & pad it, which, in my opinion makes for a frustrating read.I give it 2 stars because it does contain some useful information, if you can tolerate & get past the author's overstated & condescending writing style
0	Don't waste your money. The paintings in this book were of very poor quality.  Some were even smeared.  Couldn't wait to send this back
0	A rather boring translation of the great Dreigroschenoper. One has to know and understand the original German text of the Dreigroschenoper to be really able to judge the quality of the English translations. This one, used among others by Helen Schneider on her album  with Weill songs, has nothing of the sarcasms of the German lyrics. Better  read the 1954 translation of Marc Blitzstein or the translation made by  Frank McGuinness in the early 1990s
0	Poor evidence of sources. Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions. There is an obvious French slant on history throughout the book. And in some cases there appear to be insertions of &quot;local legends&quot; or Francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than Toussaint-Samat's statement (i.e., fabricated quotations attributed to Charlemagne's biographer in the cheese story on pages 116-117 - look it up!). In a generalized, broad-spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact. But, that being said, the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical (at best!) inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book, as an authoritative source, into question
0	What they didn't teach the writer about writing. While the "facts" in this book are interesting, it is such a difficult read.  How any editor let this book by is beyond me.  You can find out more about our society and the events of this period by visiting a retirement home as compared to reading this book.Paraphrasing that switches from first to third person and overall rambling makes this a terrible read.  This book reads like a high-school project
0	Superficial advice, save your money. This book was a big waste of money.  The information is so basic only a real novice would learn anything.  And don't believe the positive reviews  you read for Kelly's books.  It's obvious he wrote them himself, since no  one with a brain would praise the kind of junk he puts out
0	Ruination. Dear God in Heaven . What a dreary little effort this is and what a disappointment after A Simple Plan . GReat idea for a very short story. Bad idea for a novel . In the end  ( if you can finish the tome ) you'll be rooting for the plant to do its darnest and quickly
0	Making Meaning:  How Successful Business Deliver Meaningful Customer Experiences. I skimmed through the book and found it to be of little meaning.  There did not appear to be any substance to it.  I sent it back for refund.  I have never returned a book before this one.  I am not sure why this book was published.  Try again.
0	NASTY  SPRING. A friend of mine gave me this book to read, and I was shocked by the poems.  The words that can best describe them are DISTURBING AND PORNOGRAPHIC.  I was embarrassed to read them, and, believe me, I don't embarrass easily.  The poem "The First" is so sexually graphic that it belongs in an adult only book store, and should be so labeled.I like poetry that is uplifting, about traditional themes such as love (not just sex), the beauty of the natural world, etc.I gave this book back to my friend, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.Sincerely,Alex Charles
0	In the tradition of Kenneth Anger... Probably no biography is without some value, but this is one of the two worst Chaplin books published.  The comedian was hardly a perfect man, and there are things about him even a long-time fan might find bothersome, but much of this biography is trashy and filled with unsubstantiated ugly rumors.  David Robinson's CHAPLIN:  HIS LIFE AND ART, published twenty years ago, remains the best way to learn about Mr. Chaplin's complex life and work, while Glenn Mitchell's CHAPLIN ENCYCLOPEDIA I have found very helpful.  This book is best ignored and forgotten
0	Who's looking out for the sexually harrassed?. Glad I was able to borrow this rather than buy.  It his his show in a book.  By the way I have never seen such consistantly low ratings.  Could it be that the majority of his fans can't read?  I have to believe this guy makes a few bucks between his show, radio and books.  Why does he have to fall to the level of hawking factor crap on his show.  Even Hannity is above that.  I gave him 1 star above the default minimum for spelling and grammer. 0 for useful content
0	fairytaleaficcionado. interesting, well documented, with marvelous illustrations.Definitely a good buy for adults who still dream  of fairy tales characters. It is a pity that the collection does not include stories from "One thousand and one nights". Otherwise it will be perfect and complete.
0	Pretty worthless. I'm afraid this book is pretty useless as far as factual information goes. Few texts are properly cited and  John Paul I is quoted as saying all sorts of things--ie condemning Moses--which it's pretty hard to credit. Many of his public speeches are available and they don't support the contentions made. Both David Yallop's and John Cornwell's books cover the same material and are vastly better; though they write from very different perspectives
0	I need another book just to understand how to use this book!. I am currently entering my 3rd year of nursing, and of course, the school that i attend also requires the use of this hateful book.  I found it very difficult to use.  The only recommendation I have is, contact your instructors early enough and hope they help you to understand this demon
0	Avoid the book and movie. No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself
0	this is ridiculous. I don't like fat people whether they are men or women.  Americans each too many calories and do not get enough exercise.  there is no Adonis complex.  i can't believe a guy actually spent his time looking through playgirl centerfolds to write a book.  buy a book on cycling or other exercise book... it'll be money, time and health better spent.  get outside and do something.
0	not so great if you're looking for accuracy. As a person who spent over 2 years in Ghana and became pretty familiar with Adinkra symbols...I was disappointed with this stamp kit.  I was excited when I saw this kit online but should have read the reviews before ordering as I see several other people felt let down too.  I can hardly believe that the author left out the most well loved Adinkra symbol of all, "Gye Nyame", a symbol about the power of God.  I really wish the author had put more effort into her research and included the names and accurate meanings of the symbols in the Twi language.  Bummer
0	Declining Significance of Race?. The book has a compelling argument, because many of us would like to think that racism is a thing of the past.  It takes away the responsibility from people to end racial inequality, because racism is no longer the cause.  I agree with Wilson that class inequality is bad and that it does impact African Americans.  However, there is a store of research showing that racial discrimination still plays a real, solid role in the continued marginalization of Blacks. You would be hard pressed to find an African American who has not experienced racism.  While, the book is not devoid of scholarship, it needs to be approached with caution.  Be critical of what you would like to be the case and seek out what is trully the case.
0	If you must read it, borrow it from the library. I just had a hard time reading/understanding/finishing this book. I did finally finish it because I wanted to know the mystery behind the author's father, but in the end the whole book was disappointing. I guess it's a matter of the book's structure. The author jumps from one time setting to another so often, it gets totally confusing! Also she intertwines different stories of different family members and other people in her life, that it's easy to confuse the characters. Some of the language sounds awkward, the curse words seem...forced. Also after a while, the author's unceasing bitterness towards life tended to grate on my nerves
0	Horrible Book. This is the worst finance book I have ever seen. For a book used for a MBA finance course it is not very helpful at all. If you are not a finance genius this book is definetly a no no. The examples leave you clueless and the theory is very general. Dare to try and solve the unrealistic sample problems at the end of the chapters, and a lot of the solutions in the solutions manual are WRONG! The professor who taught the Finance class, who has been in the field all his life and has a doctorate degree in finance admits this book is garbage and not appropriate for the MBA; beacuse of this we did not even use the book for his course. This is a very expensive and huge book and so not worth the price. I learned nothing
0	Abridged. While it doesn't indicate it, this is a heavily abridged version of the story, and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the 2002 film.  It's still a good story, but gets 2 stars for not indicating that it's abridged, and because even at 1400 pages, the full unedited story by Dumas is MUCH richer and makes for a much more satisfying story.  Do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for 1/3 of the story
0	Too narrow minded. The author spoke only from her point of view, which was Midwestern and Christian.  She devoted a huge section to church weddings, and a tiny section for any other kind, which did not help me at all.  Also, she kept talking about NOT having a wedding outdoors, which doesn't make any nature-loving bride happy, nor does it give a California bride tips on planning her outdoor wedding.  Thirdly, this book doesn't include many ethnic or cultural tips and traditions (except for the tiny part on the Jewish wedding).  Try the Unoffical Guide to planning your Wedding or the Dummies book instead
0	Just dreadful!. As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me!
0	Feeble Heart Rate Training. This book tries to do too much: it wants to be a heart rate training book AND a book about training for sporting events.  The book is only 200 pages...get the picture?   The book provides cursory information on training for various sports: walking, running, cycling, in-line skating, and  triathlon.  Obviously, if you really wanted to learn how to train  competitively for these sports, this ISN'T the book for you.  If you're  looking for a book that tells you how to create a workout you can do at a  health club on a stair-climbing machine or elliptical trainer, etc....this is  NOT the book for you.  Sure, there's a chapter on "group" exercise (i.e.  aerobic class), but it FAR from practical.  The introductory chapters  merely delineate the heart zones rather than offering suggestions for  combining them meaningfully or providing progressive programs.  The book  simply tries to cover too much in order to increase its market
0	Title should be Ross Jackson Rambles. I was so disappointed in this book that I put it aside for several years. Finally, this weekend, I picked it back up and read it cover to cover, just out of curiousity. It's kind of interesting, but it's not what it proclaims itself to be.I originally found it by doing a search for "co-housing" and/or "ecovillages". Seeing the title, "And We ARE Doing It! Building an Ecovillage Future", and seeing that it even had a hammer and nails on the cover, I wrongly assumed that it would be about the actual building of an ecovillage. I was curious to see another insight into structures chosen and rejected, and what form of internal governance they chose and why. Well, this book has almost none of that.Rather, this slim booklet is JT Ross Jackson's rambling musings about how Gaiacorp and Gaia Trust came to be. Just as he gets to the topic of co-housing, he makes a radical departure and devotes all of chapter 4 to his mystical and paranormal experiences with a spiritual awakening during a brief trip to India. At that point, I really felt like he'd lost a lot of credility to a wider audience. He goes on to do a good job detailing some of the problems he and his wife encountered setting up some "Green" financial institutions. And he does a good job describing some of the problems with the WTO and MAI and out of control Trans-National Corporations. He paints a picture of a world about to crash ecconomically, socially, and environmentally through greed. It's a good message, but the folks that need to hear it aren't going to wade through the rest of the book to get to that part. Then, he ends the booklet with a few pages of badly written sci-fi. While I happen to like futuristic sci-fi, I found it sad that the only part of the book that touched on a vision of an ecovillage and the inherent internal policy issues, had to be one set in 2064 with some very unlikely touches.I really can't recommend this book. If you already tend towards "Green" and you want a fun read, this might be worth checking out. But, if you want info on actually establishing an ecovillage this book is going to disappoint you.
0	Really stretching the truth; is wastepaper really our most significant export?. This issue with Dorgan's use of statistics was highlighted in a major newspaper this week and I feel compelled to share it with those who may not question the information the author uses to reach his conclusions.The book's author, in complaining about America's export situation, complains "That's right. America's largest export (by volume) is now "wastepaper" mostly headed for China."The hopefully obvious problem with this statement is that quantifying exports by volume is absurd in a day when economies rely far more significantly on the production of services and high-value products such as computer chips.  A cubic yard of Dell laptops clearly has far more value than a cubic yard of wastepaper.  The newspaper author went on to cite US trade statistics showing that, on a dollar basis, wastepaper is a comparatively insignificant (though undeniably bulky) export.Relying on information as flimsy as this, one would be forced to conclude that the author is really stretching to find statistics to support his protectionist agenda.  Overall the book needs to be read with a very critical eye, and perhaps added to the next ship carrying the US's largest (by volume) export to China

It does have excellent detail and structure for those interested in the subject but alas I have discovered I am not
1	A good story for your young book worm!. I read this story as a child at the school library (after seeing it on Reading Rainbow) and enjoyed it very much. Now I'm an adult and have collected the books I remember from my childhood for a bit of nostalgia. Gregory is one of them. I have also collected it for my nephew. It's a sweet story and easy to read, perfect for any child
1	Laugh out loud hilarious. Truly affecting.  It's a book that crosses genres as I'm not a parent, but I was consistently moved and often laughed out loud.  I don't often find a book that is actually "difficult to put down", but Paesel keeps your attention with her insight and delicious wit.  It's excellent
1	The Essential Introduction to 21st century spirituality. Read this book and it will change your life. Perhaps in subtle ways, perhaps profoundly. How does Seth compare to the Celestine Prophecy? How about timeless wisdom compared to hack writin
1	I'm very happy with this. I'm a strong intermediate player with some habits that limit my playing. Scott Tennant's tips helped cure some fatigue problems, helped me play with more ease and helped me to improve my tone. Scott is into the Alexander Method of body mechanics, so he understands the positions and actions that are natural for your body. (Some of the other classical guitar "giants" use contorted hand and body positions that will hurt you, and teach them as the "proper" way-  beware!) Scott has incredible playing technique to emulate, a great teaching style, and clear examples in the DVD. Besides the course material, just watching him is valuable. Does this replace coaching sessions with a master? No. You can't get that from a book and DVD. But if you want some great exercises and valuable tips that will fix the most common bad habits, this is worth every cent. Pumping Nylon really helped my playing, and explained things that my 3 teachers never mentioned
1	Rewiring the brain. I found this book fascinating.  When I was a young mother, I knew it was important to relate to my child in a helpful, healing way.  I read many books on childhood development and none gave me the information that this book does.  In the early chapters, the book explains the mechanics of brain development and the importance of the bonding relationship between mother and child.  Watching a close friend of mine with her infant son has given me the opportunity to be an educated observor of this (thirty years too late for my own child!).  The second half of the book takes the reader through a case study of a woman whose upbringing did not provide any opportunity for healthy development and whose subsequent life reflected this.  Through the parenting process of therapy the counselor actually restructured her brain, helping to close the pathways that caused pain and pathology in her life.This book would be helpful for therapist's needing to understand more fully the transformative nature that therapy can provide.  Also I think young mothers could also benefit by understanding the choices that mothers make and the consequences in raising their children.
1	An intelligent read. On one level, this novel is a whodunnit - we are following the trial of a fisherman accused of killing another fisherman. But since one is Japanese-American and the other white, the book is also an examination of racial bigotry and hatred.  It is set in the American North-West among a strawberry growing and fishing community torn apart by WWII and the internment of Japanese-Americans.  There is a love story, a vivd and visceral description of being a soldier in WWII, and the narrator's slow decline into loneliness and professional failure.  But the book scores highest when is shows us how fear turns to mistrust and mistrust to injustice and hatred, all without becoming preachy
1	GREAT READ, FROM THE FIRST PAGE TO THE LAST AND EVERYWHERE INBETWEEN!!!!!!!!!!!. MISERY----5 STARSWhen reading this book, I could not put it down.....i LOVED every single page of this book, I really enjoyed it....it was INTENSE, SAD, and FUNNY....What this poor guy Paul Sheldon goes thru is absolutely unimaginable. I cannot believe it......I feel so bad for this guy....how he adapts to living the way he was forced to, by this psycho crazy [...] by the name of, Annie Wilkes....UNREAL.....go out and pick this one up....like I said before, I couldn't put it down. It took me 2 days to finish it, and I did not speed read it, I TRULY enjoyed it, and was very disappointed when it was over. I am currently reading "IT" and I will review that one when I have finished....GO PICK UP MISERY!!!!
1	A truly  fantastic adventure. This is one of the most unique and interesting books I have ever read.The perils of PI's adventure are of the most original concepts and are justa pure pleasure to read. It is hard to talk about this book without giving away anything about the story, so suffice to say that this is a must read
1	Fantastically useful. I read Gowa's book for a graduate course, and found it to be immensely helpful for contextualizing international relations debate.  She writes in a clear style and her insights are well-articulated.  Highly recommended - research is also meticulous and precisely documented
1	Powerful little book!. This book is basic, small, and simple, but it packs a very powerful punch. Copan has a way of writing that cuts to the chase. The whole book is designed to first presenting common &quot;slogans&quot; or misconceptions  about certain things (i.e. all truth is relative), and then Copan  systematically deflates each misconception or falsity. The thing I think I  like most about the book is its simplicity. When I say simplicity, I don't  mean unintelligent. I mean Copan can take fairly complicated ideas and make  them easily understood (that takes talent). Thus, this book will enjoy a  wide variety of readers. Moreover, Copan, for such a brief work, covers a  lot of material. Copan discusses things such as the absolute nature of  truth, moral relativism, exclusivity and religious pluralism, the person  Jesus, and the reliability of the gospels. This is a very handy &quot;ready  reference&quot; work for those who have found themselves wondering,  &quot;how can I respond to that objection or comment?&quot
1	An Enjoyably Quick Read. The Itch was a good quick read that kept my interest to the end.  Although  the situations in the characters' lives could have been covered a bit more  in depth, the story still kept me wanting more.  I really hope there is a  sequel, to see how things will work out for Abra with her new  self-discovery, and how Natasha continues on with her life after Miles
1	Excellent Commentary on an unusual play. Shakespeare is not my favorite author, although I do understand the concept of his Iambic Pentameter and its style and flourishes are highly regarded.  While I can appreciate the labor it must take to put a story in such format, I frankly find the poetics of it hard to read.  That makes the commentary (which is about half of this version) very helpful to people such as myself.  By reading the corresponding notes, I was better able to put the story together with the style, making for an exciting tale.  I would highly recommend this version to people who have difficulty deciphering Shakespeare's style
1	Five Factor Fitness review. I have tried the program for three weeks now and have lost five pounds and gone from three pound weights to eight pounds without feeling overstressed.  The program is very well written and can easily be done by anyone
1	Reads like a good mystery novel. My colleagues and I have been designing and facilitating leadership development programs for about 20 years.  I've also served as a VP of three Fortune 500 companies.  I recommend this book to everyone who is a leader or who wants to be one.  Not only does it contain THE secret to true leadership, Mr. Jaworski has written his account so that it reads like a good mystery novel.  You wonder what will happen next.  And he has written this book from his heart.  I hope our paths cross one day soon
1	An important book in Science Fiction and Space History. When I was a kid, I dreamed of being an astronaut.  That wasn't to be, but this book inspired me to go into science and engineering and now I'm a successful programmer; I've heard the book influenced many other people similarly, including many who worked on the space program. If you have similar interests, I think you'll find Rocket Ship Galileo absorbing, even if dated
1	The whys of suicide. Sharon McCone's brother Joey commits suicide, and the death ties in to a case involving another suicide, that of a young man who was maybe harassed to death by an online magazine. The plot thickens as McCone delves into the shenanigans at the magazine, as well as in the life of the family who has hired her. Nobody is particularly likeable, here. It's actually a lot more entertaining on some levels than Marcia Muller's usual stuff. I liked it a lot
1	One of my favorite webcomics. Ever since I found Earthsong while wearily roaming the depths of the internet, I've been a fast fan. While I generally prefer grittier fiction, Earthsong's highly enjoyable, if straightforward, dialouge and plot keep me engaged, and the subtle (and not so subtle) references to various mythologies and other works of fantasy are well executed, rather than tacked on, as is sometimes the case in similar works. While not quite at the level of some other comics, like Sarah Ellerton's Inverloch, Earthsong's art and formatting are still among the best of any active webcomic. The facial expressions of her characters, fantastically designed in their own right, are especially well done, although certain perspective shots do occsionally come off rather odd.The printed collection itself is somewhat lacking in terms of extra features, but Lady Yates can be forgiven, considering the immense amount of dedication and effort she put into its publication, completely redrawing every page (and making vast improvements in terms of pacing and art quality). Over all, volume one of Earthsong is a must have for anyone interested in webcomics, or simply a classic fantasy adventure
1	Borderline Nation. This is one of my favorite books.  I love Wurtzel's story as well as her writing style.  However, some of the things that I most love about it are the same things that may turn some people off to it. The novel is a memoire and it covers Wurtzel's long term depression.  She writes an entire book about her suffering with this.  Naturally, some may find it whiney, self centered, or even pitiful. However, people who can relate to her struggle are most apt to find this work none of those things.  If you've dealt with depression and/or self mutilation and/or suicidality, I think you'll be able to really appreciate Wurtzel's openness.  I read this book quite awhile ago so I can't recall whether or not she calls herself this but to me(I am a mental health clinician), she is very borderline(having Borderline Personality Disorder). Although the book is not advertised as being a memoire of BPD, I find it to be one.  The last thing I want to mention is that I would be careful about recommending this work to someone who is actually in the throws of depression.. It is not the most hopeful work and may not boost anyone out of a depression if theyre already in one.
1	BRHS reviews Misfits. Stop your searching, grab your car keys, and head towards your local bookstore, or for you new high tech types head for amazon.com, because you must read James Howe's coolest book yet called The Misfits. The Misfits is defiantly one of those books you just absolutely have to classify as a classic. The story follows the seventh grade years of Bobby Goodspeed who is the all about lovable "fat kid" that everyone teases. Along with some of Bobby's close friends, he sets out on a quest, under the guidance of a some what pushy friend named Addie, to add a third party to the student council elections that will stand up for the so called, "minorities." After being called a very wide range of names about his "fat" Bobby dares to take the elections by storm, but as all you readers should know the unpopular kids don't always get the votes. No matter how good their campaign may be to win this election Bobby and his team will have to really give the students something to say wow about.Readers this book is a must read for gossip fans. Any one who was once a little kid in school always trying to stay on the "in" of who was doing what with whom. From the begging this book explodes into your mind with a very interesting twist of a start, not what you would expect for a book talking about a school election. The book keeps its potential as it adds a few unexpected little twist with characters personalities and emotions, but don't worry readers, Howe, who has written many children's books, keeps the story easy to follow. Everyone will love this story! After all I don't know how many people can resist a story about a fat kid, a tall smart kid, a 70's gagster kid, and the infamous misfit of the time, a gay kid.Readers Howe has really captured the troubles of being a teenager. Even if the characters are in the seventh grade, with the present times it won't be long until these problems really do hit home for the seventh grade era. When I was reading this book I really could relate it to the life of a high school freshmen, so don't be surprised, readers, if you too find yourself connecting to the plot. Readers over all I give James Howe's The Misfits four stars out of five. "Sticks and stones will break our bones, but names will break our spirits.
1	Great Overall Book. I thought this book was amazing.  While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination.  The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head.  This is definitely the most influencial book I have read.
1	Another Good Sams. Sams again turns out a great home manual for working with a complex product
1	great book. My girlfriend gave me this book and told me I needed to use it to have a long life.  After reading it, I think it will help me do just that.  This book has great advice on health and nutrition, and I hope I can have the discipline to put its instructions into practice
1	fun for all ages. This is a great book! It has wonderful illustrations, hence The Caldecott Medal, and an engaging story. My son loves this book, especially turning the pages to find out what the overcoat will become next. This is not just a children's book, since I gave it to my professor and his wife and they both loved it. This is one of the books that I don't get tired of reading over and over
1	Inspiring, informative...and good karma!. This is one of the best books I've read about the business of voiceovers, and I've read them all. Hearing "how they did it" from some of the best performers in the country makes for a fascinating read, but there's plenty of real world information from the artists as well, including marketing tips, studio conduct, union membership and the "art of the craft."I appreciate that the proceeds of this book are being donated to the Alzheimer's Association. As a voiceover performer myself, I'm acutely aware that the word "voice" means much more than simply an instrument for talking. The voice is the means by which we convey our soul; it is the stream of our identity. Successful voiceover performers, such as those featured in this book, are able to convey emotion and heart through their work, and the listener has a sense of who they are from the way they shape the words. All of us who make a living in this business have contemplated losing our voices, but for an Alzheimer's patient, the loss of voice is much more profound than losing the ability to communicate; it is the loss of identity. Using a book focused on voiceovers as a means to fight a disease that robs its victims of their voices is inspiring, and very creative.For voice performers, this book is a wonderful addition to your personal library. If you already make a living using your voice, or hope to, purchasing this book is an investment--you're "paying it forward" as you learn from the best in the business.
1	excellent reference guide. This is my favorite handbook for chrocheting.  I use the pattern gallery to create my own sweater and scarf designs.  It is very easy to understand the directions
1	Sing It Sister!. Finally, a woman writer, attempting to help women!  Regardless of her political preferences, one can not ignore the convicing arguments establishing how so many liberal democrat powerhouses, do indeed attempt to suppress other women's happiness.  Regardless of your political affiliation, if you are a woman and seek to be happy, you should read this book.In order to get the full benefit, you will need to devoid yourself of emotion and drama, and read this objective non-fiction book as purely factual.  Although this is very difficult for women to do, it is possible, and although you may feel as if the author is attacking you, she is not.  Stick with it, and you will realize she is one of very few women powerhouses, who are actually on your side.Whether you want to be happy is up to you.  Happiness is not defined by others, it is defined by yourself.  You may try to appear to others as though you are happy, but if you desire the deep-down contentment, read this with an open mind.  It is about the best therapy you can reap
1	Very Enjoyable and Informative Read. The History Buff's Guide to the Civil War by Thomas R. Flagel was very informative and provided this individual with many bits of information that haven't been seen before.As an individual who reads twenty or more civil war books each year I would strongly recommend this read to those who desire those little bits and pieces that are not usually found in more well known publications.The book is well written and presented in very readable fashion.Well done
1	THE BEST GIBSON. PROBABLY THE BEST GIBSON YET. A MUST READ FOR HIS FANS AND A GOOD BOOK FOR NEWCOMERS TOO. A REAL THOUGHT PROVOKING READ!
1	Exciting Urban Projects. A great collection of different planning straegies. Provides unique and refreshing solutions for designing different urban hardscapes, mostly in the U.S. and Europe. It is also well put together and well thought out
1	No better time to get your Ahimsa and Satyagraha. This is a book that should- and will- profoundly affect you.  On the one hand its wonderful and inspiring.  But I find myself instead feeling heart-broken.  Mournful.  I grieve for an alternate reality where our leaders have either the education, curiosity, wisdom, or courage to embrace the lessons of great people such as Gandhi.  It's not exactly esoteric stuff.  Everyone knows the name Gandhi and has at least some sense of where he stands historically.  Even for the non-readers, there was the movie.  It was a big deal.Gandhi's true transformation occurred when he realized that violence is demeaning not just to victims but to the perpetrators.  It is an intoxicating release of sadistic impulses.  Impulses that are addicting and toxic.  I was reading this book and think about the state of the world, and found myself thinking the tired clich:  give peace a chance.  It feels so trite, a well-worn sixties throw-back.  But it also a courageous sentiment.  Peace takes courage and creativity, and it isn't as quick and easy as violence in the short-term, but it is more than just a dream.  Peace is a bold assertion.What kinds of things crossed my mind when I was reading this book?  When John Kerry returned from Vietnam and testified about atrocities being committed by both sides, he was vilified by the right wing, portrayed as a traitor.  But it was an act of courage.  He obviously wasn't saying we should stop the war because American soldiers are bad people.  He was showing how violence leads to more violence, how the violence of an unjust war corrupted the souls of good young Americans who were drawn into warfare.  Violence leads to violence, but most importantly the converse is also true.  Non-violence is just as contagious.  We see peace leading to peace on all levels, from the macro international level all the way down to individual relationships.  Another example that crossed my mind is the all-to-recent transformation in the culture of inpatient psychiatry.  In the past, restraining people was considered a good treatment option because it quickly stopped dangerous behavior and gave staff a sense of control and safety.  But now, the attitude has changed.  Restraints are no longer seen as a treatment option but instead as a treatment failure, a last ditch resort for extreme cases only.  And the results?  People are actually safer.  Violent patient behavior eventually goes down when staff thinks creatively of non-traumatic solutions.  Those are some of the things that crossed my mind as I read this book.Something else I like about Gandhi, as reflected in his writings:  Whether or not you believe he was born destined for greatness has to do with your spiritual bent, but either way, he accomplished what he accomplished as a political leader and philosopher through the hard work of personal journey and spiritual exploration.  He was an anglophile when he was young, buying into the classism of the oppressors.  When he became radicalized after witnessing the cruelty and the glee with which the British soldiers repressed rebellion, the pendulum at first swung all the way the other way.  He became a separatist, not unlike Malcolm X prior to his spiritual transformation.  In fact, Gandhi was almost a middle-aged man before coming up with the magnanimous observation that violence degrades all involved, victims and perpetrators alike.  That was a surprise to me actually, that Gandhi rejected separatism at an older age than Malcolm X did.So read Gandhi.  Read, share your books, talk about what it stirs up.  Dream of a better way.  And find a way to act on your dreams.  And read John Stuart Mill, Emma Goldman, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Edward Said, Chomsky...  Agree, disagree, but read with an open mind.Sorry for all the chatter.  Thank you for listening, bye bye.
1	Believe in Your Art Ability. This is a fantastic book on believing in your ability to be an artist.  It also teaches you to do art on a daily basis to stretch and grow in the varied mediums.I have kept journals for years, but never art journals.  I was amazed at all of the fantastic work that can come from drawing on a daily basis.  I even started drawing with pen rather than pencil to allow the mistakes to be there and not be afraid of them.I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't believe they have any talent in art and for those who do and have been told over and over again that they just aren't quite right for 'today's art market'.  Get out there and draw!
1	The awk bible a must have tome for all Unix power scripters. I second the feeling here, this awk book is the most concise, clear and useful scripting book on unix period with the exception of perl. Its also a job life saver. At work we cant use perl on our unix servers because of management attitudes so awk and sh are the only tools to script with. Become a Unix power scripter with this cool book
1	Book sale. I wish I had noticed that the book was in paperback form; I thought I had bought a hardcovered bookThe item was as stated. And I appreciated the fast deliver
1	Another generation to add to the fun!. In this book we are treated to another generation of Emerson, and even though they are all under six, they do add to the story, and give us all something to look forward to in upcoming books.  I also recommend that this book should be read in order.  So many of the things that happen in each book are dependent on things that happened in previous books.  This is another great adventure that is set in Amelia's beautiful Luxor.  Even though The Great War is over, it doesn't mean that the Emersons are in less danger.  Danger always seems to find them in the guise of tomb robbers, murderers and other nefarious characters.  I won't say anymore.  You will need to read this wonderful series for yourself, but be prepared for an exciting journey when you first begin your journey with the beloved Emersons
1	She knows what she is teaching... First a warning: I bought this planning to hand it off to my disorganized junior high school kid who gets either A+ on his homework or F- because he cannot find it in his backpack.  BUT this book is written for the parent.  And it is a great book.  It is an easy read in the best sense.  The book is very logically organized, progressing thru backpack, workspace, locker, etc...  The author became a professional organizer many years ago when she had to rescue her own disorganized kid.  We spend so much time and money teaching our kids English, math, foreign languages but we forget to teach them how to organize their work and thereby teach themselves.  It was worth the price for me
1	A work of applied philosophy. On of the most basic conflicts in any management is the conflict between quality (do it right) and output (do it fast).  Crosby starts our with the typical north American assumption that the two are embroiled in a zero-sum game, and then he blows the lid off - suggesting that by focusing on quality you can increase throughput.  For example, by spending tens of thousands dollars on education to *prevent* heart attacks now - spent only on a targeted risk group - a health insurance company could avert heart attacks later, saving a million dollars or more.  For a second example, if a manufacturing table has physical waste (scrap) and labor waste (re-work of bad parts), both can be eliminated by having zero defects in the first place, with a net increase in performance.Crosby also spends a little bit of time talking about how to inspire the workforce to save money with a 'buck a day' program.Then Crosby provides step-by-step suggestions on how to implement those philosophies in a manufacturing environment.  I give the book four stars because it is a little dated, and is heavily oriented toward manufacturing.  Still, this is a classic in the quality movement.  If you are studying quality, don't go for the five-page summary of Crosby's ideas - go to the source
1	shows a deep understanding of science fiction themes. As a longtime science fiction fan, I thought I was reasonably versed in the main themes of this field. But Moylan's critique is at a far deeper level than my usual comprehension of science fiction. He writes at an analytic depth that shows a deep appreciation and awareness.For you to get the most benefit from his book, you should already have a background in traditional English literature, as well as science fiction. The utopias and dystopias he studies in the latter are correlated and contrasted to themes already present in the broader literature. Unfortunately, I lack that traditional background, and so much of his arguments were lost on me.
1	Best bedtime book!. Very sweet & relaxing.  I've read it almost every for the last year.  Calming & sweet, before they understand animals.  Fun after they start learning about animals, babies & parents.
1	ANYBODY's guide to goats. I first bought this book several years ago for an 8-year-old friend who was getting her first goat.  I think I have borrowed it back half a dozen times, and regularly recommended it to adults as well as &quot;kids&quot;.  Although geared toward children, it does NOT talk down to children.  It tells the reader (of any age) everything the novice goat owner needs to know without all the extra detail that just gets in the way when you are looking for the basics
1	Ruskin's Venice. This is a deeply inspiring photographic account of Ruskin's commitment to Venice.  It serves as a remarkable and revelatory companion to Ruskin's THE STONES OF VENICE and, to any one who cares about this city, it is an  entirely necessary book.  It is difficult to imagine how it might have been  done better
1	An extensively researched and scholarly accounting. The Dead Sea Scrolls and the New Testament offers expert analysis in the study of The Dead Sea Scrolls by George J. Brooke, Rylands Professor of Biblical Studies at the University of Manchester, England. While most studies draw links between The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Old Testament, The Dead Sea Scrolls and the New Testament demonstrates how scholars can use the Scrolls to learn more about the linguistic, historical, religious, and social contexts of first-century Palestine and therefore better understand the New Testament. An extensively researched and scholarly accounting, with a select bibliography, and separate indexes of Bible references and Non-Biblical sources.
1	Invisible Cities worth reading at least once. I was recommended this book from my friend shortly after finishing graduate school when in need of a good detox-read.  To me the book was far from the brainless entertainment I was hoping for.  In fact, Invisible Cities was full of thought provoking and poetic images of imaginary cities expressed through dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublia Khan.  At first I was struck by the unusual premise for the story and then later struck by the highly symbolic descriptions of the cities.  Through Calvino's use of symbolism I began to have a different appreciation for the forms and structures of cities and civilizations.  This could have been the first time I really thought about cities as a living architecture and the container for our memories and dreams.With all of the above said, one problem I had when reading Invisible Cities was my mind seemed to easily drift off the page.  The book reads more like poetry then a novella and I felt that halfway through the book the form of the chapters became almost too redundant.  I think that if I were to re-read the book and spend some time with it I could have gained greater insight into Italo Calinvo's perspective and creative mind.  Although I am not rushing to re-read it anytime soon, I would possibly read it again in the future
1	Hillarious!. The first time my father read me this book, he fell of the chair laughing! I was right behind him
1	A good book for beginners, but mediocre for more advanced readers. Most of the things that Cassandra Eason describes are in fact a lot easier than they seem from the book. Psychic development is a personal discovery of one's own natural abilities. Thus it is unfortunate, that certain things and the techniques that the author talks about are simply not true or incomplete. In her defence, however, it has to be said that a lot of these abilities, such as clairvoyance, or astral travel, etc, are techniques that are very difficult to describe. I would say that about 80% of the techniques outlined in this book could work, whereas the remaining 20% are nonsense.For someone, who already has certain psychic abilities that he or she is aware of, this book will probably be a disappointment. You'd be better off looking for something more specific. However, for most people who are yet unaware of their abilities or who are just interested in what is possible, this book will be very good, as the general outline is excellent. Further, this book provides some very good examples of what is possible within us.This book should be awarded 3,5 stars out of five, since it is generally very good, but fails to deliver some consistent information. It is a very good book for beginners thoug
1	You Just Have to Know Where to Look. Scott Weidensaul deserves recognition as one of the best naturalist writers working today. Here, Weidensaul follows in the cross-continental footsteps of Roger Peterson (the bird guide guy) and James Fisher, who in the early 1950s wrote about their bird watching journey across North America and created the environmentalist classic "Wild America." Weidensaul is also a bird fanatic, reporting on the astonishing variety of avifauna he encountered while tracing the footsteps of Peterson and Fisher, but he also imparts great amounts of knowledge on all other forms of wildlife as well as larger issues of ecosystem health. Weidensaul certainly finds that many of the natural areas visited by Peterson and Fisher fifty years previously are in worse shape nowadays, with encroaching development and pollution, and great decreases in plant and animal populations. The most distressing example here is the continuing ecological disaster taking place in the Florida Everglades, while the state of nature in several of the other areas covered is barely heartening.However, Weidensaul actually finds that nature is surprisingly strong in some of the areas he visited, such as the quickly urbanizing Rio Grande valley in Texas, or the forlorn Pribilof islands off of Alaska. Concerned local citizens in many bountiful areas are fighting for preservation and sustainable development, though there is still much work to be done. Weidensaul's main point is that wilderness and wildlife is certainly on the decline, and there's no reason to sugarcoat this troublesome reality. But there are still pockets of tremendous natural vitality in North America if you know where to look for them. Weidensaul also fleshes out his great environmental reporting with occasional snippets of realistic politics, which is a departure from his previous works. This includes an outstanding final chapter in which he covers the state of environmentalism in America and tells it like it is, with an honesty far beyond that of pundits and sloganeers.

1	A must for all early education centers. This book outlines developmental stages of growth in childhood.  It is easy to read and understand.  The parents in my program rave about this book and there is a waiting list to borrow it from our library
1	******WONDERFUL and I'd give it more STARS if I could!!!!!!!!******. I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye is such a wonderful, wonderful book!  To see my thoughts, actions, and feelings of everything that comes along during the grief of a loved one, particularly one lost by a sudden death.  I was even comforted by carrying it with me for over a year.  Just having it near me helped so that I could read it anytime.  I recently borrowed it to my best friend who just lost her younger sister to suicide and I actually feel very naked without my copy!My favorite aunt was murdered by my uncle (her husband/my mom's brother) and then he committed suicide.  Trying to deal with it was so hard because I felt there was no one in the world who understood my pain, my fears, my irrational thoughts, "griefbursts", guilt, and that overwhelming feeling of being lost.  This book helped me to find my way, to know that everything I was feeling and thinking was completely normal, and just to see it all in print is such a relief.  I've also lost an uncle to a heart attack, friends to suicide, other friends to vehicle accidents, and also the loss of a grandparent who died of old age; and this book has helped me to accept all those I've lost in the past and to realize that all people grieve differently, that there is no time frame for it and that no one can tell you when you're ready to "move on".  This book gives the griever power to accept what has happened and move through the grieving process and to understand it a little better.This book teaches you the grief process from just about every point of view possible (parent, child, sibling, friend, etc.), gives you tips on how to cope and memoralize the ones you've lost, advice on where to seek professional help when needed, and the writers tell their own stories of loss and everything they experienced.  I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye mentions the taboos surrounding sudden deaths such as suicide or homicide and lets you know that it's OK to talk about it and that you need to talk about it.Just an absolutely wonderful book on grief after a sudden death loss.  There are very few out there that will compare to this one, especially since this isn't a book about faith, as many grief books are.  It's a straight-forward grieving process gold mine!  I also purchased the workbook that accompanies this one, however, I did not get around to actually doing it so I don't know if it would be helpful.  For those of you who are comfortable with journaling, the workbook would be an excellent compliment to the text.Sorry for those of you who are having to look for this, but I am telling you, this is a wonderful book and one of the best out there!
1	A Key to Understanding the Enigma of U2. Christianity, metaphorically, has many "keys." Many prominent voices play major keys, promising blessings and offering comfortable settings. Christian Scharen, the author of One Step Closer, introduces a minor key--the theology of the cross--that fits U2's voice."The theology of the cross fits U2 because it avoids the all too common proclamation of faith, hope, and love that ignores the present realities of doubt, despair, suffering and injustice. It is a tradition that looks at the world and speaks the truth about what it sees: the good, the bad, and the ugly. In the words of the church reformer Martin Luther, the theology of the cross `calls a thing what it really is.'"This book helps "make sense of U2's style of talking about God, Jesus, the Spirit and the Christian life in a holistic way." It's an excellent resource for those wanting to understand the spirituality found in the band's lyrics.It also serves as a mini-lesson in theology, especially as it pertains to the cross and the different forms of communication found in the Bible. The author provides keen insight into the psalms, the wisdom literature, the parables, prophecy, and apocalyptic writing in the first section of the book. In each chapter a different pattern of speech is examined with examples of how U2 mirrors the style and content of that particular form.The second section focuses on the theology of the cross. With U2, it's a way of singing "truthfully and unflinchingly about God and the world God loves. It is a way of speaking that highlights faith over certainty, hope over despair, selfless love over the self-indulgent pursuits that tempt the church and its leaders to grab power and money for themselves." Once again the author provides specific examples from the band's music.The last section introduces the idea of living the truth as a way to live the cross. It provides an account of how U2 lives out their faith. For U2, following God means doing the truth.One can easily come away with a greater understanding and admiration for what U2 is all about. The band deserves credit for not succumbing to the popular self-fulfillment trends in the Church.What's especially valuable is the author's ability to introduce readers to the Christian tradition by illustrating from U2. His thoughts on cross-centered theology are rewarding and worth more than one read.This is a scholarly but easy to read work. The author displays a mastery of theology and U2. He more than adequately supports his contentions through Scripture (almost exclusively from The Message Bible) and an analysis of the band's lyrics and interviews. This book is a valuable edition to the growing volume of literature on U2.It would have been helpful if the author would have elaborated more on some of the controversial elements of U2. Though it may be a minor thing, their seeming indifference about drinking, smoking and swearing is hard to understand. Their critical attitude toward the Church and some Christians is understandable but a little troubling.Some Christians feel that U2 is not Christian enough. Ironically, you can see from reading this book that U2 follow in the tradition of the cross by speaking honestly and pointing toward sacrifice and service toward others. In so doing, they have turned it around and indirectly challenged the Church and individual Christians to be more Christian.
1	Beautiful Gift Book for Christmas. This is a simple, yet beautiful book of pop-up paper scultptures, each representing a theme from A to Z. It is not a book for young children, but rather for an older child or an adult who appreciates simple elegance and dramatic paper sculptures. This is also a great book for people who like to collect alphabet books. It also makes a beautiful "coffee table book" during the holiday season
1	Do You Dare to Look Behind the Attic Wall?. Maggie is a troubled and unloved child.  Shunted from boarding school to boarding school since the death of her parents,  life begins to change for her when she's suddenly moved to the home of the great-aunts she did not know existed.  The old ladies' strange ways baffle Maggie.  Only very odd Uncle Morris seems interested in Maggie.  Soon after arriving, Maggie begins hearing voices in the old house that no one else can hear.  In her search for the source of the voices, Maggie finds a secret place and a way to regain the loving childhood and acceptance she so desperately needs.NOTE:  This story is at once both fascinating and scary. Not for sensitive children
1	Code of the warrior. In Marcus Aurelius we find the roots of chivalry for the warrior code.  A classic work for anyone interested in history or military history in particular.  Stoic philosophy for all but especially the warrior in us all.
1	Great bedtime reading. "New Sudden Fiction" is filled with little gems--great to read before bed, while in the tub or when you have a few free minutes. The best stories leave you wishing for more.  There are author bios at the end of the book so you can explore more fiction by your favorite ones
1	Everest of the Ocean. Once a year in northern California a swell of waves appear, large enough to crush a town, that can only be described as terrifying. This once hidden surf spot is known to the surf world today as Maverick's. The story begins by telling about surfing's roots in Hawaii and the long, flat pieces of redwood they used to surf on. In 1969 Greg Noll, a highly respected surfer, caught a thirty-foot wave at Todos Santos, an island off of California. Todos santos was thought to be a America's last word in surfing until Maverick's was discovered. The book focuses on the five most dangerous days in Maverick's history. On the first day, the celebrated surfer Mark Foo was killed on a wave that crashed too soon. The wave sent him into a bottomless pit of white-water, where he drownd. A memorial service was held to honor his life. After the surf world discovered Maverick's the first competition was held there entitled The Men Who Ride Mountains. Darryl Virostki won the event after a huge cutback and an arial off a fifteen-foot wave. Maverick's today remains won of the biggest names in big-wave surfing. I recommend this book to all surfers
1	Fantastic. You know the plot.  Rebellion against authority.  You've seen it re-hashed a hundred times, but never treated this well.  In Cuckoos Nest, Kesey has made the authority palpably evil  - malicious and vindictive.  He's made the innocents perfectly pitiable.  He's made the rescuer a brash brawler fueled by testosterone - not admirable, but respected all the same.The Big Nurse embodies the tyranny of small minds who gain power, absolute power, over those who are helplessly subject to them.  She rules with cold authority over her ward of mental patients, twisting them inside so that they'll never escape her machinations until Randall McMurphy appears in the ward, having conned his way in to avoid work detail in prison.  Thus begins a battle of the wills that is full of high comedy and tragic results.Even told through the perspective of a giant Indian mental patient, McMurphy's acts are not glossed over as the pranks of a fun-loving mischevious kid.  The hatred that he and all patients on the ward have for the Big Nurse seeps out of the pages.  McMurphy's goal is to make them into men, not cowering rabbits, and his final Pyrrhic victory transforms the men around him.This is a modern classic that you will not be able to forget
1	Look into this NOW -- you won't regret it!.

Check out the website for more examples of how it works: www.yourethicalwill.com
1	Great book for preschool and up. I really enjoy this book and have given it as a gift many times. Good for slightly older kids (not toddlers) as the fingerplays are a little on the hard side for very young children. We enjoy this book a great deal
1	EXCELLENT. This book is excellent! If you don't have a finance background but need to understand the financial statements this book will teach you everything you need. If you already know about finance this book will teach you what you don't know
1	A great psychic mystery!. Others have given the plot of this book in their reviews, and done it very well, so I'll stick to giving my opinion of the book. Abby does a favor for a friend and ends up trapped by a Mafia boss who pulls no punches in getting Abby to work for him. I found this book to be slightly darker than the first, because the Mob boss is one REALLY bad dude.  All the characters that I love are here, starting with Abby herself. Ms. Laurie makes her such a real person, and such a likable one, that I wish I could meet her and her troop of friends. (Especially Eggy!) This is a great murder mystery and had plenty of psychic insight for those of us who love that sort of thing. I loved this book and have read it twice so far. Like revisiting old friends. I have also read book three and can't wait for 4 to be released in Sept. Read and enjoy
1	If Liberals talk about the author instead of the book. The book must be true
1	Mayra Calvani. Since its creation in 1919 by pulp writer Johnston McCulley, the character of Zorro has captured the hearts and imaginations of young and old alike. The infamous, romantic hero has been played by numerous actors through the decades, from Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the 1920's to Antonio Banderas in the late 1990's. Now, Isabel Allende, born in Peru and raised in Chile, bestselling author of highly acclaimed literary works such as The House of the Spirits (1985), adds intricate texture and a new dimension to the legend by blending the two things she is best known for, magic realism and historical fiction.Born to Alegandro de la Vega, a Spanish aristocrat, and Toypurnia, a Shoshone Indian warrior, Diego de la Vega (a.k.a. Zorro, or "fox" in Spanish) is a product of his mixed heritage. His grandmother, White Owl, a healer and shaman, plays an enormous role in the formation of his character. At an early age, while witnessing the injustice committed against Indians, his alter ego begins to show as he becomes increasingly obsessed with justice. Together with his inseparable, mute friend and "milk" brother Bernardo, Diego is initiated into manhood in the Indian tradition and it is during this experience that he comes into contact with his spirit totem, the fox.At sixteen, Diego is sent to Barcelona for a classical education and, while perfecting the art of fencing with Manuel Escalante, becomes a member of the secret society La Justicia, where he pledges "To seek justice, nourish the hungry, clothe the naked, protect widows and orphans, give shelter to the stranger, and never spill innocent blood." During this time, Zorro falls hopelessly in love with Juliana de Romeu, becomes best friends with her sister Isabel, has a duel with Rafael Moncada, and organizes several rescue missions in the midst of political upheaval. Eventually, together with Juliana and Isabel, he's forced to leave Barcelona in disguise. They walk across Spain, live with Gypsies and are captured by pirates. To Diego's chagrin, Juliana succumbs to pirate Jean Latiffee's charms. Eventually Diego and Isabel make it back to California, where Diego's father has been imprisoned on charges of treason. As if this isn't enough, his mortal enemy Rafael Moncada has followed him here seeking revenge.There's no doubt Allende is a gifted, consummate teller of tales. Under her pen, Alta California and Napoleonic Spain come alive in their most vivid, historical detail. From the modest adobe houses and exotic war paint on Indian faces to the filthy, excrement-filled dungeons and the black eyes of Gypsies to the sparkling diamonds against the plump, white dcollet of Spanish belles, Allende offers us a vibrant saga dripping with adventure, romance, history, politics and a touch of magic.It's a pity, though, that Allende spends a large part of the book in the trivial, Barbara Cartland-style romance between Juliana and Jean Latiffe, while Zorro assumes a secondary, nearly silent role, to the point where one has to wonder whose story is being told.Like many other Latin American writers, Gabriel Garcia Marquez among them, Allende uses the omniscient point of view and her paragraphs are long and almost entirely devoid of dialogue. This evokes a magical quality, the sensation of sitting in front of a bonfire while listening to an old and wise storyteller, but at the same time causes a lack in dramatization. One can't help thinking that Allende has so many stories to tell that if she added dialogue, the book would easily turned into a one-thousand page manuscript. Of course, the lack in dialogue, and so much "telling" rather than "showing" pertains to style and not to a lack of literary skill. Another interesting aspect of Allende's writing is the power she gives to most of her female characters. Damsels in distress? Not in this novel! The women here are wilful, intelligent individuals to be reckoned with. Allende also keeps the identity of the narrator a mystery until the last chapter.Though Allende ultimately fails in lifting Zorro from his place as a two-dimensional, comical character, her remarkable prose and action-packed story make this book a pleasure to read.
1	How the West was lost. This is a fantastic classic detailing the demise of the plains Indians and deals with them incident by incident, tribe by tribe, chief by chief from around the 1850s to the early 20th century.If the only good Indian was a dead Indian, and if civilisation was to prevail, this book is a stark examination of the lack of morality in the process, or at least the victory of might and legality over right.One thing never mentioned in discussions about the US war of Independence is that the British wished to maintain treaties with the Indians and protect their land rights wheareas the Washingtonians were already in the process of making a land grab before the war took place.  The Indians took the side of the British and they had hell to pay long afterwards as they were wiped off the face of America, along with the Bison.Geronimo, Sitting Bull and Custer's last stand.  Read about it here
1	More than simply Stimulus-Response psychology. Anyone who accuses B. F. Skinner of championing a mechanistic, stimulus-response psychology needs to read this book!  In it, Skinner takes the reader on an exercise in looking at the world and our place in it through the lenses of personal learning history and the cultural context influencing what is important (primarily Euro-American---but one can only handle so many things at once.)  Although, as other reviews have written, some of the terms and circumstances date the book, the themes contained within remain valid
1	Great from personal experience.. I'm a UC Berkeley student who has recently taken prof. Dundes' folklore class...this book is part of the reading list (hehe, well, if you're going to teach, might as well use your own book, right?).  You'll enjoy &quot;interpreting folklore&quot; for it's interesting stories and witty writing...Dundes really knows what he's talking about and has always been very clear about getting his point across, even in his lectures...his books, then, are even more succinct and concise.   Buy this book and support the work of a down to earth, awesome professor/folklorist who is passionate and dedicated to this topic. ...plus, be entertained and educated at the same time!  Great deal
1	A deficit of cartoons to accompany this awesome book. This is one of the best of the best of the 'really ticked off conservative white guy's rage against things' genre I've ever read in a bookstore.Miller has had enough of his own party, who have become a bunch of far-left insane madmen intent on destroying America (starting with the armed forces that cost $80 gazillion a year) and now it's time to rage.  Miller just goes off on this, that, and the other thing, pointing out how low our culture is, how our values are in the toilet, and how the conservatives are on the run from Hillary Clinton's army of replicants, etc, etc.But the best part of the book is when he blasts insults at people, at various lowlifes that occupy the media, rappers, political hacks, etc, etc.  I mean, what's better than a guy going loco about a 'deficit of decency' than a guy letting fly with various insults and indecent remarks to make his point about this 'deficit of decency'.  See, Miller makes the point by being indecent, and showing you that there is a deficit of decency in the USA.Conservatives on all sides have no power anymore, so instead of doing anything about the appalling celebrities that run our nation, or rappers who say bad things, they write really bad books about how bad things are.  Then we all join the Republican party, and the country gets even worse for 90% of people.  At least we know that formula works!  Here's to hoping Miller and others like him return the USA to the days when we had a decency surplus
1	Great book, great advice!. After being at my wits' end trying to figure out just what was going on in the head of my scaredy-dog, I picked up Brown's book.  On page after page, she described behaviors I was seeing develop, and offered solutions to those behaviors.Fortunately for me, my dog is not as scared as the ones she describes were.  That said, many of the techniques she outlines have been saving graces for me.  Most importantly, I now use a crate in the car when I drive with my dog.  No more barking wildly at buses, motorcycles, other dogs, and trolleys!  No more trying to clamber out the window after those offensive pieces of machinery!  I have no more fear about how my dog is going to act in the car, and she has a lot more security while being in the car.There are many other strategies I will consider using with my scaredy dog.  If your dog is the kind of dog who reacts unpredictably in a wide variety of situations and you want to keep your dog, other dogs, and other people safe around your dog, this book provides a strong and solid base from which to begin your work.  Highly recommended
1	--Powerful and Unforgettable--. GODS AND GENERALS is an extremely well done and fascinating book.  The author, Jeff Shaara, did an excellent job of interpreting the characters. His task was a difficult one because his father's book, THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.  This book precedes the one written by his father.GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles. The major players in the story are Winfield Scott, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.  The career biographies of these famous men were striking.  After reading of their early lives and service experiences, it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army. They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends.I listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.  He brought the characters to life by his narration. This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history.
1	A Vital and Prophetic Tool. A wonderful teaching tool.  This book, like a solid, trustworthy, open pathway into the future awaits the readiness of men and women who are called into Interspiritual ventures in their response to God's call upon  their lives.  This book is like a hidden map rediscovered by folk who are  following their depths into the inevitable, realistic and mystical unknown  that awaits the faith-empowered who say Yes to the Journey. THE MYSTICAL  HEART is inspired by a Mature Spirit of Wisdom.  It is a practical, vital  and prophetic tool that will resource, encourage and guide us to greater  consciousness and awareness in our work
1	As good a detective novel as you will ever read. From page one the strength of narrative and the wisecracking of the PI Bernhard "Bernie" Gunther is a detective novel readers dream.  Philip Kerr is able to bring 1936 Berlin alive it all it's nationalistic insanity.  His ability to describe how the Nazi party had taken total control of this nation is remarkable.He has picked-up the nuance of how people delude themselves into believing what they are told, no matter how implausible.Right from the start you know that Gunther is as cynical as you can be, without being arrested by the Gestapo (which he is at a later point of the book).  The way he weaves the disillusionment of the average German, while at the same time showing how they just acquiest to what was going on.  Unlike most books about Germany at this time, he presents the Nazi's as people not cardboard cutouts.  He does, though, show them in all their sadism and brutality.  But it is a brutality that has become humdrum and expected.  No one is surprised by what is going on.  Everyone is just hoping it doesn't happen to them.Especially appealing is Gunther's gumshoe comments and asides as to what is going on.  At one point he gets out of his car and gives the "Hitler salute" when the party standard is paraded by. His comment, "it's not worth taking a beating for not saluting". He tells of a circulating joke, that next to Jews, Hitler hates homosexuals and cripples the most.  The punch line is that everyone but Hitler knows that his Minister of Propaganda, Joseph "Joey" Goebbels has a club foot.You can just imagine Robert Mitchum or Humphrey Bogart playing this "fleabite" PI.  He drinks, he smokes, and he's like a junkyard dog when it comes to doing his job.  There are great descriptions of the war between Reichfurher Himmler, the head of the Gestapo and SS and Prime Minister of Prussia Hermann Goering.The ending, is just a pregnant pause, we know that there are two more books in the "Berlin Noir" trilogy, and that's the way that Kerr leaves us at the end of this book.  You know you have to read the other two
1	The Cutest Child's Book of All Time!!!!!!!. I had this book for a very long time, and I loved it!  It's a cute book  that teaches children the alphabet and it's a cute game that I used to play  when I was younger.  I still have this book, and I have a reason to:  When  I become a mother and have kids of my own, I'll be able to read it to them!   :
1	A compelling tale that's truly educational. I read Paddle-to-the-Sea as a child (I was born in 1942), and its story, illustrations and maps have left lasting impresssions on me. It blends social studies, geography, 20th Century American history and wonderful artwork into a gentle, loving tale. It ought to be required reading for all American youths
1	Spooktacular. Some time ago I read one of this author's other books and it was undoubtedly one of, if not the best book of this type that I had ever read. I was therefore understandably excited when I found this book and began to read because I expected another masterpiece of the ghostly kind. What I found however was something quite good but just not up to the standards that I had set for this author. I must admit that I may be being a little unfair here because if I had come across a book this good by almost any other author I would have been impressed but from Jeff Belanger I just expected a little more. This grand master of the ghost hunter world has just set the bar so high in his previous works that it's going to be almost impossible for him to reach the same level of perfection with every new book. I guess that I'm just going to have to accept that fact, whether I want to or not.Over the years I have come to the conclusion that eyewitness accounts are indispensable to this type of book and that without them all you really end up with is a bunch of old legends. Belanger has a history of excellence in this area and this book is no exception. If anything he takes eyewitness accounts a little to the extreme in this case. The stories in this book are made up exclusively of interviews with eyewitnesses and these first person accounts are generally excellent. One pitfall of this style is evident in this book however and that pitfall is that some of the interviews will obviously be better than others. In other words, some people are just naturally more articulate than others while others are very articulate in person but their words seem to become less clear on paper. Overall though the interviews were excellent and were conducted in a very professional manner.The biggest problem that I had with this book however was that the author relied far too much on the eyewitnesses for the possible history behind the haunts. In some cases this worked just fine and the subjects were intimately familiar with the background of the ghosts in question. In other cases though there was little or no history to be found and it is sometimes hard to really get a feeling for a haunt without knowing what might have caused it. A little research by the author would have added immeasurably to a few of the stories but once again I may be being picky because this author has shown himself to be a more than capable researcher and I found that I really missed his work in this area.Still, this is one fine book of ghost stories and one that any ghost enthusiast will want to read and own. The interview with George Lutz alone is worth the price of the book and I must applaud Jeff for having the courage to take on such a controversial subject. Also included is an interview with a nephew of Ed and Lorraine Warren (another controversial subject) that is quite frankly marvelous. This is without doubt a five star book so I just regret that I couldn't give the last book I read by this author six stars
1	This book and the &quot;Quality Pioneers.&quot;. One of the unique qualities of this &quot;Five Pillars&quot; book is that it covers in detail the contributions of all the early &quot;quality pioneers&quot;--including Juran, Deming, Feigenbaum, and Crosby. It also covers the works of others who have contributed to our knowledge on &quot;management&quot; matters writ large--not just the far more narrowly focused &quot;quality control&quot; literature. For example, the works of Drucker, Iacocca, and the like are also covered and blended with those of the quality pioneers. The &quot;Five Pillars&quot; praises Deming for what he contributed to the quality movement, but also places his contributions in their needed perspective for those seeking real and not superficial results. Accordingly, it is not suprising that one Balaji S. Reddi from Pune, Maharashtra, India would not like the book. It will be noted that Balaji S. Reddie is an electrical engineer who specializes in teaching the &quot;Deming Way.&quot; In fact his e-mail address places him at &quot;DemingIndia.org.&quot; Within the pages of the &quot;Five Pillars of TQM&quot; the prediction is made that the book will draw flak from those who have turned Deming into &quot;The Man Who Discovered Quality&quot; and the &quot;patron saint&quot; of quality management. It took a long time for the flak to arrive, and then all the way from India!  In fact, a deciple of Walter Shewhart of the Bell Laboratories along with Joseph Juran, W. Edwards Deming made contributions of the &quot;SPC&quot; and &quot;SQC&quot; variety of &quot;QM&quot; but provided false and irrelevant guidance on most of the broader management issues. &quot;TQM&quot;--a term invented by General Bill Creech--is likened as &quot;Total&quot; because its reach is far broader than a set of quality control tools--and the &quot;Five Pillars&quot; book says that in an unambiguous fashion. (&quot;Process&quot; being but one of the five pillars upon which success is built.) What is taught at the DemingIndia organization is unknown to this reviwer, but according to Balaji S. Reddie's reaction it is certainly not the broad based approach to &quot;quality management&quot; that the Bill Creech book is all about. Read it and verify that for yourself
1	Want a tattoo? Read this book. This book takes you from figuring out what to put in your skin, to how it gets in your skin, what your body does to the ink, and how to care for your tattoo after. And, the history bits were fascinating, and the inside lingo, and how to attend a tattoo convention, and, how people may look at you differently, and where to put your tattoo... oh, heck, this is THE book to read about getting a tattoo. It's a great read even if you're just hooked on the TV tattoo dramas. (Kat ROCKS!
1	Elisha Watson Book Report Rules of the Road. This is a great book for ages 12+ and up.Joan Bauer has mad another great book. I could relate to it a lot from the family being divorced to not knowing much about the rules of the road. It takes place in, Chicago, Illinois during the hot summer. Jenna Boller is the best employee at her branch of Gladstone's Shoes-she can sell anybody anything. she is sixteen-years-old and has had her driver's license for six months. But her family problems are harder to handle, especially her drunk dad, and there are times when Jenna wishes she could just get out of town and take a break. Her dad is a drunk and embarrases at her job. So when Madeline Gladstone, the elderly president of Gladstone's Shoe Stores, hire Jennna as her driver for the summer to take her from Chicago, to Dallas Jenna leaps at the chance-right in the driver's seat. And that begins a cross-country adventure. They learn a lot about the rules of the road... and the rules of life. Jenna is having a nice time driving Mrs.Gladstone around and spending nights at the hottest hotels and most expensive places to eat. Mrs.Gladstone's son is wanting to take over the business because he says that his mother needs to slow down and enjoy the rest of her life. The only problem is that her son,Elden and her aren't very close with relationship and so they don't talk a lot. Elden only cares about the money, not the customers. He will try to sell you anything no matter the price or how it feels on your feet. Later, in a couple of weeks they are going to have a meeting where people will vote and decide who should still be president over Gladstone's Shoes. Jenna meets Henry Bender, the best shoe-seller in Texas. Jenna only knows him for about a week and it's like he becomes her own father. She never really had a dad who took care of her since he was drunk all the time. She mostly took care of him. Then some disturbing news happen, Mr.Bender was killed in a car accident hit head-on by a drunk driver. Jenna's heart is crushed. The real conflict of the story is that right before the meeting that determines who is the president, Elden captures Jenna and gets a plane ticket back home. He takes her to a taxi cab and leaves to the meeting. She tells the taxi to turn around and go back to the meeting, she sneaks in and stops everything. She gives a speech and lets everyone know that Elden is just looking for money instead of quality. Everyone votes for Mrs.Gladstone to stay the president! As Jenna and Mrs.Gladstone arrive home Jenna thinks to herself, all this time she has bent over backwards for her dad and was scared to hurt his feelings for not wanting to see him since he is drunk all the time. Then she realizes that it doesn't matter what her dad wants, she has been their when he wasnt' and she hasn't gotten anything for it. She understands now. She wondered why her dad had to be a acoholic. Now she knew, it was to make her stronger, different and most importantly it showed her how to say no in the darkness. This was a powerful yet hilarious book. I will most likely read it again and never forget it
1	Every Man Fights His Own War. I salute this author for his writing talents of transporting us literally into another space and time that not many of us will ever know of.I can only imagine the horrors of what our fathers went through.I can only hope that I should one tenth as brave as they were.I can only hope that it never happens again.Jones' use of the written word in this work is comparative in a way to the late, great Thomas Wolfe, and another- Virginia Woolfas lyrical poetry in a technical development.Five Stars.
1	You Bring Out The Elvis In Me. ELVIS IN JERUSALEM is less about the "Americanization" of Israeli society than it is about the "de-Zionization" of Israeli culture.Segev, one of the foremost Israeli "New Historians" (i.e. revisionists) sees the liberation of Israel from its drab, early, khaki-colored socialist-collective Pioneer culture as necessarily a good thing, and treats the resultant influx of American products, values, norms and even language as an amicable step toward globalization and Israeli normalization.Segev is correct, to an extent. The severe and essentially narrow views of Israel's founders have fallen further and further out of step as the State of Israel has matured. As early Zionist philosophies have withered, pluralism has flourished. Where Ben-Gurion and his fellows wanted to create a socialist "New Hebrew" human being and a parochially secular yet all-Jewish state out of the disparate elements of European, Oriental and New World Jewry, Israel today embraces a diversity of practices, and has re-embraced Yiddish and Ladino culture, as well as that of Jews from other lands.As the State has grown politico-emotionally there has been an increasing tendency to treat with the resident Arabs---Israeli Arabs and Palestinians both---on a more evenhanded basis. This is all to the good.Segev addresses (but of course cannot resolve) the inherent contradictions of living in a democratic, secular State in which Jewish clergy or Zionist philosophers control certain key social structures. These contradictions affect all Israelis, no matter their ethnicity or faith, and create the dynamic tensions which drive Israeli society forward (or back, depending on one's views).Segev views the American model as key. He revels in an open, pluralistic, multicultural society, but seems too close to the issue to see that these elements can also cause profound social schisms as they do in the U.S.. He never acknowledges the "Wal-Mart-ization" of this consumer culture, the substitution of instant gratification and cheap junk for quality and bedrock values, as in the least destructive.Segev seems to view most Israeli schisms as overwhelmingly political ("Palestine" versus "West Bank" for example) or religious ("Who is a Jew?"), rather than directly addressing the sea change in Israel from Pioneer Culture to Organization Man Culture, which, in effect, is the same sea change that has altered the American social fabric.Segev's "New History," in which he questions and debunks the accepted institutional mythos of the re-establishment of the Jewish Homeland, is thought-provoking. It would have been better and stronger had Segev bothered to document the majority of his statements and sources.Although Elvis, a Melungeon of Sephardic Jewish descent, has long since left the building, Segev provides the American reader with a view of an Israel profoundly altered from the day of CAST A GIANT SHADOW, a modern, vibrant, complex and confused place full of living, breathing human beings.
1	good not just for review but to learn. My son needs some real education in math (he is 7.5 years old in second grade).  I use this book to set the curriculum and scope of teaching him math.  This book serves as the basis to learn pre-calculus.  So far he loves it and understands math is not all about just addition/subtraction/multiplication and division.
1	Thorough history of Mary. As a Protestant convert to Orthodox Christianity I had the usual misgivings regarding the elevated role of Mary in the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. This book gives a thorough and scholarly approach to how marionology developed over the centuries in both the eastern and western traditions of the church. It was very helpful in enabling me to better appreciate why there is such a veneration of Mary even though there is not much biblical revelation about her. The most surprising thing to me was the Muslim connection to Mary. This book will certainly fill in your knowledge and appreciation for Mary and how she developed into such an icon of the church
1	The Answer. While devouring this book, I really felt that I was getting close to, quote unquote, "The Answer."  That's how powerful it was on both me and, as I see, some of my fellow reviewers.  So much of it has to do with making decisions, and making decisions is an integral part of Soren K's definition of truth.  But you have to get at it subjectively, not objectively.  There's one part where, let's say, you (the reader) are in prison, and you will get your head chopped off by the guillotine tomorrow.  You are afraid, naturally.  I, as your friend, can talk to you and say (objectively), "Oh, you're worried about the guillotine tomorrow.  You see, it's very simple: you just walk out to the scaffold, put your head down on the slab of wood, making sure to put your neck in the appropriate neck hole; they will cut a rope, the blade of the guillotine will come down, your head will be chopped off, and it will all be over in a minute."  You, the subjective decision-maker, do not see it in the same way
1	Taking Sides:  I'll Take the Whole Book!. This series of books is a must for anyone interested in modern political thought.  It is as interesting as &quot;Crossfire&quot; with more substance and depth.  The editors' political experience shows in the selection of authors and pieces chosen.  Though I'm sure the editors have their own opinions, both sides of each issue are well represented.  They have carefully culled differing points of view from intelligent people who make their arguments persuasively.  Highly recommended
1	Mobius rocks. I am a new knitter. After taking a class on the Mobius method, and getting into Cat Bordhi's fun and quirky head, it will be very boring for me to pick-up any of my other started projects. I have this and the first book, and was able to create many quick christmas presents that were a hit. Cat has found many ways that have simplified so many of the knitting methods, I am now able to transfer her methods to other knitting book patterns that I was afraid to try. I highly recommend trying these 2 books, you won't believe how how fun and strange it is, and knitting will never be the same for you
1	Babylon 5 is the best show ever made!. Babylon 5 is the best show ever made! The depth of which J. Michael Straczynski has created is far beyond all other Sci-Fi series or books I have ever heard of. He is Genius
1	An excellent work for Aikiju-jutsu beginners. I am an instructor of Goshin Ryu Aikijiu-jutsu and I really enjoyed this book. It is well organized and readable. The action sequence shown in the photographs is very clear. If you are familiar with the principles common  to all styles of this art you will be fond of this work, particullarly with  the references to counter-techniques, rarely seen. An excellent book
1	Enjoyable, hilarious, and hold up over time. Never read a book by this guy, but he's touted as being against big government, so I thought I'd take a swing. It's a pretty scathing book, and I loved every minute of it. O'Rourke tackles all the politics of the day, the day being just after Bush I took office. What's great about going back and reading a book like this is seeing whether or not his predictions came true. Not that there are a lot of predictions, but the ones that are there are pretty dead on.The great thing is that O' Rourke actually does some journalistic work. He spends a day or two in Congress, tags along with congressmen, checks out government offices, interviews foreign dignitaries, etc. and comes away with some great conclusions.Because of that, O' Rourke is able to do something that seems almost impossible: humanizing politicians. These guys work hard. I guess you would have to in order to waste the money and time the government does. But they work hard and they believe in what they're doing, no matter how ridiculous it actually is. So essentially, we have not necessarily elected crooks and thieves to Congress, rather, we've elected good people way out of touch. Oh, and some of them are crooks and thieves.But O'Rourke puts the blame squarely where it belongs in a democracy. He does, that is, if you believe voting makes a difference. I guess that's what makes him a Republican and what makes me....not. Don't worry, though, if you're a Democrat. O'Rourke seems to be an equal opportunity scather, and the situations he presents will make even the staunchest advocates of babysitting government try to figure out how we allowed this to happen.  Being neither a Republican or Democrat allowed me to squeal with glee at just about everything he wrote.We did, though, and thank goodness. Otherwise, we'd never get a fine book like this
1	The Platonic ideal of a historical novel... perfection. This is a book that dumps you squarely in the agora, the symposium, the trireme and the battlefield. There is not a single wasted syllable, not one sentence that rings false. Like a Mozart symphony, it is exactly right - the Platonic ideal of what a historical novel should be. Being set in the era of Imperial Athens, it naturally incorporates its own tragedy - more than one, in fact. Almost effortlessly, it leaves you understanding just why the Athenians behaved the way they did and how their arrogance led to disaster.Great historical figures spring from the pages, with all their faults and weaknesses as well as their magnificent virtues - Plato, Socrates, Alcibiades, Xenophon, Critias, and many others. Yet alongside the lucid rationality of Socrates, which rings true down the millennia, Alexias and his contemporaries inhabit a world of gods and demons. Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Athene and the Furies are just as real to them as the mountains and the sea
1	Overall a very unique and informative book. I read this book with some anxiety being a college junior and not a psychologist or psychiatrist.  I learned of it from my dad, a philosophy professor.  I thought it was really superb and answered many question I had about homosexuality.  For example, I am not gay and ever since the Matthew Shepard incident, I have been trying to understand why gay and lesbian people are the targets of hate crimes.  It didn't seem to me that the motivation for hatred of gays is exactly the same as hatred for other minority groups.  "Sexual Orientation and Psychoanalysis" explains the way that the homophobia-particularly in men has its roots in childhood- particularly the last part of childhood.  One point it stresses is that it often seems to be traced back to middle school years and is a special type of bullying.  Going back to my own experience with schoolyard bullies when I was in 6th grade-this made a lot of sense.  I also learned a lot about the different pathways for sexual development in men and women.  I now understand why "homosexuality" is not just one "thing" and how different gay and lesbian people are from each other.  I was surprised to learn how similar the sexuality of lesbian is to heterosexual women, and gay men- to heterosexual men (even though there are also differences of course).  Not all the material discussed in this book had equal interest for me.  For example, I wasn't all that interested in the last chapter which is about the way psychoanalysts have thought about homosexuality over the years, but it was enlightening to better understand why they used to think that homosexuality was a mental illness.  I did read some Freud and some of my teachers  hated him and some admired him.  At least with respect to sex-I appreciated knowing which of his theories are simply out of date.  Friedman and Downey think that some of Freud's views are still helpful as well.  All in all I give this book an "A" grade- and -even though it is demanding-it is worth the effort to read it.  One good thing about it is that it is very clearly written and without psychobabble or jargon
1	Not her best, but very good. I was a little wary of reading this book since she was never able to get it published during her lifetime despite trying for many years. I assumed that if she couldn't get it published that it probably wasn't very good. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this book. It is meant to be a satirical work mocking the Gothic romance popular during Jane Austin's lifetime. In such romances, there were fictional monsters and secret corridors and such, and in this book the main character, Catherine, keeps thinking that such things were going to pop up or had popped up, but they never really had. Towards the end, instead of some fantastic mythical monster, a real monster emerges as the culprit behing the pain Catherine experiences: pride in rank.  The father of Henry Tilney, whom Catherine has fallen in love with, refuses to allow them to be married because Catherine is of a lower rank and has less money that his family does.  Austin vilifies the wealth heriarchy of her day through both Henry's father and through her friend Isabella who tries to do anything that she can to marry someone wealthier than herself, leading Catherine to much pain.This is nowhere near as good as some of Miss Austin's other works, but it is good nontheless, and a fun read. It's much better if you understand what Gothic romance novels were like, since this is a satire on those novels.Overall grade: B
1	The content id Amazing. The amount of theory it's attached with a lot of circuits, and all easy to estudy and also deploy.Some circuit displayed are the easy way to have commmon problems in the electronic's life.its a good choice!
1	Similar but different true, but it may help build tolerance. I doubt that "Jesus and Buddha: The Parallel Sayings" will convert many Christians to Buddhism or Buddhists to Christianity.  I hope that it will help to build tolerance between the two religions, which is what I believe is the author's intent.  "Jesus and Buddha:  The Parallel Sayings" shows that there are many similarities between the teachings of Jesus and Buddha.  Both were great spokesmen for compassion and nonviolence.  However, by focusing on the similarities between the teachings of Jesus and Buddha, this book might be somewhat nave about the differences between Christianity and Buddhism.  A couple of reviewers have pointed to "John 14:6 'I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except by me.'"  The reviewers appear to be using the inherent intolerance of this teaching as a selling point for Christianity.  For me it was the intolerance of such biblical scriptures that drove me away from Christianity, the religion that I was raised with and that I once strongly believed in.  I could not reconcile how such teachings can be of a loving or just god so I eventually reached the point where I could no longer believe in or worship that god.  I then gradually started searching for another belief system.  Because of both the similarities AND the differences, Buddhism had a naturally strong appeal to me.  Buddha's teachings against attachment, even to his own teachings, are especially appealing to me.  Perhaps Jesus was actually speaking against attachments to biblical scriptures when he said "I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except by me."  Perhaps he was saying that only his words were the true words of God and telling his followers not to allow them selves to become attached to biblical scriptures that preceded him or may follow him (i.e.: some have argued that Paul was a corruptor of Jesus' teachings).  Unfortunately, if that is what Jesus meant, many Christians do the opposite.  They attach to biblical scriptures that allow them to chastise the sins of others and let go of Jesus' teachings.  This is especially true of his teachings that interfere with worldly profits, egos or vengeance (i.e.: "that which has Caesar on it belongs to Caesar", "it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the gates of heaven", "remove the log from your eye before pointing out the splinter in your neighbors", "let he who is without sin cast the first stone", "if someone strikes you, turn the other cheek", etc.).  Regardless of how Jesus may have meant "I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except by me", it is most often used as a teaching of intolerance toward other belief systems.  Books like "Jesus and Buddha: The Parallel Sayings", "Living Buddha, Living Christ", "Spiritual Advice For Buddhists And Christians" and "The Good Heart: A Buddhist Perspective on the Teachings of Jesus" might help build tolerance between the two religions.  That is why I am giving "Jesus and Buddha:  The Parallel Sayings" five stars.  Unfortunately, such books cannot change the inherent intolerance of some biblical scriptures.  That makes the task of these books much more difficult
1	Falling in love with "Anger". This book is a gem. Among many good qualities, it continued to deepen my understanding and compassion for that sensation we experience that we call "anger". The meditation in the back of the book is beautiful, as is much of Thich Nhat Hahn's writing. I read it to my yoga classes during relaxation at the end, and read it before bed often to sweetly and softly connect to this "human experience.
1	Fast Fun and Flexible ways to learn and teach. This is the most useful training book I have ever read. The format is easy to read and it is easy to learn the concepts. I have been doing training and psychotherapy for twenty-two years and I am an NLP practitioner. I  learned many valuable new things.  Especially the importance of teaching  all the types of intelligence's. I now realize that when I get all  excellent evaluations except for one or two I may not be hitting that  persons intelligence.  The marketing ideas are a very welcomed addition.  This book has helped my training and business immensely
1	Read before you visit the park. To begin with, I don't agree with game hunting at all. However, if you're planning on visiting Jim Corbett park in Uttaranchal Pradesh, India, I'd strongly recommend reading this book before you go. The park is beautiful, but knowing some of the history and the insights into tiger behaviour that Corbett provides is fascinating.
1	Great intro  for small  children. You've heard of being a little mouse in the room or a fly on the wall?   Well, Sammy is a spider on the ceiling! This is a good intro to Rosh  Hashanah for small children, who will love the big, colorful illustrations.   I also like the Sammy Spider series because it portrays spiders in a  positive way.  Spiders are our friends -- they eat flies and other annoying  bugs, and are nothing to be afraid of
1	VERY INTERESTING BOOK. SPOILERS!! BE WARNEDThis book is so freaky and thats why its great.  Its got a horror touch to it as those robots are pretty scary the way it does evil but acts like its doing perfectly righteous acts.  One reviewer mentioned that the main character is not likable. I dont know what he's talking about because the main character is totally great, honorable, just, basically everything you want in a human being or a hero.  The story is great because you can never guess whats going to happen next.  It keeps changing.  The ending at first seems pretty horrible, and I didnt realy like it but I think if it didnt end this way this book woudnt of made such an impact.   Oh and this book is exactly like that one star trek episode from the original series called NOMAD where that machine tried to "steralize" everything one but killing it.
1	The Immune System Cure: Great Info. This book is really helpful. Shows how certain supplementation can aid the immune system and the mind body connection in relationship to the immune system and is written in clear and concise form and intended for the layman. It covers some of the following topics - Thirty Days to Boost Immunity - Fats That Heal, Fats That Kill - Genetically Engineered Foods  - Plants Provide Great Disease Protection - Killer SugarEating Too Much Depresses Immunity - Yogurt: Super-Immune BoosterHow Can I Eat Enough Greens? - Fabulous Fiber  - Greens in a Glass - Protein for Repair - Are You Digesting What You Eat?Pure Clean Water - Green Tea: Your Coffee Substitute  - Your Body Has the Power to Heal - Nutrition: Cancer's Formidable Foe - Why Do We Get Cancer?Why Are North American Cancer Rates So High? - What Is Cancer? - Attitude Is the Key to Survival - Natural Therapies Pack a Punch Case History - Detoxification Diet: Jump-Start Immunity and much more! - I found a really good source of M.D. backed information on immune health with supplementation --  if you are interested email healthnc_at_aol_dot_com and request immune health info.
1	Delightful Range of Essays on Current Topics. This is a great collection of issues and debates in science that those of us out of the field -- or even involved in other research fields -- will find interesting.  They're as clearly written as editor Oliver Sacks' works and each has at least one topical issue to catch the reader's interest.  Some have several.Each story has something fascinating about it:* "The Forest Primeval" tells about an area of the Congo which humans hadn't penetrated -- and the impact of the wildlife on the ecology.  There are some surprising elements to it, including that it might once have been populated by humans.* Mann's article from Atlantic Monthly goes through what the New World might have been like prior to Columbus -- and highlights a debate between new historians and traditionalists over whether the continent was empty -- or whether Old World diseases killed up to 90% of the population before colonists began arriving.* "The Learning Curve" deals with the practical skills of learning to be a doctor.  Don't let me in the hospital any time soon . . .* "Notes from a Parallel Universe" deals with the people who try to convince scientists of bizarre theories.  At Berkeley they even keep the crackpots papers.* Learn about Seattle's Yuckies in "Shadow Creatures."* Gunjan Sinha's article on voles indicates that what you might be experiencing isn't love but a hormone called oxytocin.* The article from New Republic titled "Fighting Chance" is a great story of research -- and how a scientist's career decision got made.* "Why Turn Red?" unravels part of a mystery for why leaves turn red, an energy-consuming activity that often occurs when the leaves are at the end of the photosynthetic life.* If you want a GREAT theme for a scary kids story for a fiction class, the stuff in "Got Silk" has the raw material for good science fiction.* The essay on Hawking is interesting, if only because the bet that it refers to from 1997 was just settled about a month ago -- with Hawking admitting that he was wrong.* Cassuto's essay from "Salon" portrays the impact of a scandal on the science world, where the collateral damage can be as broad as in the financial world.* And finally, the last essay does justice to the career of Stephen Jay Gould, as a biologist, essayist and ardent enemy of creationist influence on public policy.* Plus, you can even learn which TV show retired lab chimpanzees prefer.I'm a sucker for the "Best American Short Stories" collections issued each year, but this collection of science essays exceeded my expectations.  So much so that I sent it to my daughter at college
1	A painfully honest book. I found Yancey's truthfulness to be refreshing. Whether you read this book as a Christian or someone just searching, you will find, I am sure, that Yancey is honest. In fact so honest that there are times that you feel like cringing. Why is Yancey revealing family secrets? Should he point out our weaknesses like that?I learned a lot from this book. I learned that a relationship with God is a difficult one because it is a relationship between a finite being with limited understanding (me) and an infinite, all-knowing God. No wonder I have problems relating.I suppose one of the most common questions people ask is, assuming God is, why he doesn't show himself to us? Yancey does not admit to have all the answers but what helped me to understand God's `reluctance' to show himself to us is that if he did it would remove our freedom of choice; we would have no choice but to believe. One of the wonders of this world is our free will.I think for those who are honestly seeking ultimate truth, this book will go some way in pointing someone towards the Scriptures and ultimately Christ Jesus himself. In the end, what will matter is our individual relationship with this invisible God.One gripe with Yancey was his reliance on Catholic authors. For an evangelical (if he is one), he leans so heavily on Catholic sources that one would think he was a Jesuit priest. But that criticism aside, I would highly recommend this book.
1	Read it again...for the first time. With the identity of Deep Throat now known, All the President's Men has an added bit of excitement.  I couldn't help but think, "wasn't it obvious?" as I read it and thought of Deep Throat's true identity.  Reading it, I realized that Woodward and Bernstein didn't try to hide the secret as well as all the speculation over the last 30 years would lead one to believe.Don't be like the taxi driver I had late one night in D.C. this summer who said he didn't need to read this book because "I lived through it."  Man that guy was a jerk.  He would not shut up
1	Home is Where the Hurt Is. Tom Bissell is fond of sprinkling aphorisms throughout the stories in this fine collection, so let's lay one on him:  Only a young man with his entire life stretched out before him could afford to be so pessimistic about life's possibilities.Granted, he's writing about places it's easy to be pessimistic about, god-forsaken Central Asian Republics spawned by the collapse of the Soviet Empire, places that are a "combo of Soviet paranoia and Muslim xenophobia" as one character puts it.  Five of the collection's six stories follow this pattern: take a (young) American; drop him or her into a central Asian country; stir; chronicle the resulting disaster.The first story, Death Defier, is probably the best.  A free-lance American photographer gets caught in a difficult situation in Afghanistan while trying to help a British reporter felled by a virulent strain of malaria.  The story poses an interesting question:  can you dive so deeply into the mechanics and aesthetics of war that you become immune to death-terror?  Bissell grapples honorably with the complex sensibility of war correspondents, people who are voyeuristic and deeply engaged, often at the same time.  Aral is about Amanda, an American biologist sent by the United Nations to study the shrinking Aral Sea (a hall of fame ecological screw-up).  Amanda consistently misreads the intent of the people around her.  She displays that combustible American mix of idealism, aggressiveness and ignorance of the local culture that's served us so well in Vietnam and Iraq.Expensive Trips Nowhere and The Ambassador's Son are ugly American stories.  In an Author's Note, Bissell acknowledges his debt to Hemingway's The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber for Expensive Trips Nowhere, which is about courage or the lack thereof on the steppes of Kazakhstan.  The Ambassador's Son is about what you'd get if you dropped the Jay McInerney of Bright Lights, Big City into the capital of Tashkent.  It should be noted that Bissell writes well about sex, giving it neither more nor less significance than the situation he's describing merits.  The final story, Animals in Our Lives, is the only one set in America.  Franklin, a recently returned expat English teacher, and Elizabeth, a med student, spend an afternoon at the zoo and experience the moment when it comes clear they don't have a future with each other.  It's a sensitive rendering of the kinds of pain your intellect can't protect you from.The title story, which won a Pushcart Prize, is about Timothy, a missionary in Samarkand whose faith gets subverted by physical urges.  Bissell gets the succumbing to temptation part just right, along with the heartbreaking juxtaposition of sex with hope that pervades the world's downtrodden places.  What's missing is a visceral sense of the struggle to hold on to God.  God may not live in St Petersburg, but Dostoievksi did, and the master understood that sin gains heft through the hubris of the sinner.  Something enormous was at stake for Dostoievski's spiritual criminals; they pitched themselves willingly on to the pyre, inviting and accepting oblivion for their defiance.  Timothy settles for the tiny oblivion of orgasm, then sits in a fug of post-coital remorse waiting for God to ring him up.  He's simply not a big enough person to carry his part of the argument, so the story falls short of the tragic dimension it tries to achieve.There's a lot to like about Bissell as a writer.  He's willing to engage with far-off, difficult cultures, and willing to wrestle with big ideas like death and sin.  He writes a prose that's both erudite and plainspoken, which is hard to do.  He can be both trenchant and expansive in his observations, often in the same well-turned phrase.  His efforts to describe the ways in which the personal and political infuse and alter one another takes him into territory mined so productively by Graham Greene.  While each of the individual stories may not be perfectly realized, it feels like there's something at stake here, maybe something important.He's an author work rooting for, and I'd definitely buy his next book.
1	"Why I Chose You" Gregory E. Lang. Powerful, emotional, exceptionally well done.  A perfect gift for anyone who has adopted a child and beautiful reading for the extended family.  It captures the almost indescribable feelings that unite a parent and child and will, at some point, be a valuable tool in expressing those feelings to the child.
1	A fable for the modern reader. Checkov was a master of composing life's largest problems into beautiful language and ordinary situations which the entire world could understand.  Granted he wrote them a long time ago but the underlying situation exists everywhere today.  Here are three sisters completely unable to move on with their lives.  They are unhappy, they are desperate for a change of scene, they are forced to give up anyone they love to someone else but yet they remain glued to the exact place where all of this occurs.  Olga has passed her prime, Masha loves someone other than her husband, and Irina has no idea what could possibly make her happy and all they do is talk about change, but never do anything active.  And in the end it all comes full circle and we as an audience, a reader, need to decide how to not fall into such a life rut, to learn by their actions as we do from Aesop's fables.  This play is just written a great deal better, with a little more comedy and tugging at the heartstrings
1	Framework Design Unraveled - Recommended for Developers & Architects. In the object oriented design and architecture, business objects are simply the entities which abstracts the physical entities in the domain that the component is written to represent. In "Expert C# Business Objects" Rocky Lhotka goes above and beyond this definition and walk us through the different steps of encapsulation, abstraction, behavior representation and business object implementation with distributed systems.Let's face it, in the coder to developer transition, one starts developing a framework on the top of the application program framework (.NET/J2EE) which abstracts and empowers the development by providing easily maintainable reusable code segments. This happens in the phases, either consciously or unconsciously and the end result can range from couple of utility classes to a n-tier architecture with support for network communication, database object relational modeling and web services interface. This book is efforts of trying to escalate this concept into practice by making developers understand the advance basics of framework design. In this 800 page book, Rocky has divided topics into eleven chapters all focusing on one specific area of framework design namely Distributed architecture, framework design, key technologies, business framework implementation, data access and security, object oriented application design, business object implementation, windows forms UI, web forms UI, web service interface, report and reporting and batch processing. Even though its focused on .NET framework based technologies, this book can be used for developing frameworks in other programming languages and platforms as well.Like other framework design enthusiasts, I've been following Rockford Lhotka's writing for quite some time now along with his development of CSLA.NET framework. CSLA stands for component-based Scalable Logical Architecture which is now in version 2.0 and provides a great deal of flexibility and power in terms of business object design. CSLA is an object oriented software framework which provides a standardized way to create robust object oriented programs using business objects model. Author in this book discusses design strategies, common problems they solve and lessons learned. Being a Microsoft regional director, a Microsoft MVP, and an INETA speaker, Rockford Lhotka has much exposure to the industry to do research in void. There has been significant community contribution in the CSLA framework as discussed by author himself in a recent episode of .NET rocks and I'd strongly disagree that this book is a manual for CSLA.NET. There is a catch 22 in framework style books i.e. either you can be theory centric with code samples or provide a solid framework code with theory snippets in between. "Expert C# Business Objects" follows the second paradigm and escalates the CSLA.NET and walk us through the steps. The first approach is followed by Microsoft Development series book "Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries".If you are interested in solid, robust, reusable design and high level architectural business models for .NET, Rockford Lhotka's "Expert C# Business Objects" is a recommended read. The next version of this book with revisions and enhancements in the framework for .NET 2.0 is out now for both in C# and VB.NET titled "Expert C# 2005 Business Objects" and "Expert VB 2005 Business Objects" respectively
1	Enlightening. I read this book recently and was amazed at the amount of spiritual insight it gives.  Dr. Munroe paints a clear picture of how God created man (male and female), and explains through the word of God that men and women are equal, yet different. I recommend this book to both men and women who are searching for answers to why they behave the way they do and are looking to build better relationships
1	Excellent Book. I absolutely loved this book!  I was into it from the beginning.  From Thomas' problematic birth to the end of the story.  What a life Tommy and his brother lived.  I felt like a fly on the wall imagining everything happening.  What a tough, but inspiring life Tommy led.  His trials were tremendous and yet he overcame them all.  Eric's love and need for his brother was unexpected with his fortunate life.  This book brought tears to my eyes.  I cannot imagine the trials that Tommy experienced.  What astounds me is that there are many Tommy's in "real life".  I really look at homeless people differently now because of this book.  I could go on, but I'll end by saying: "You owe it to yourself to read this book"
1	great book but not the end all be all. This is a great source of information for the traveler.  It's the best large scope book I've found for finding information on intracountry travel via bus, train, taxi, etc.  It's also well written with a wry sense of humor.  Some limitations, however, are timeliness, as businesses are constantly opening and closing in China, and I've already found a few places mentioned in the book that are no longer operating.  Prices have also almost all gone up, despite the book coming out just a year ago.  Gotta love inflation.  The Rough Guide to China offers some better historical information and general overview of areas, but comes in short with getting around info.  I like the Rough Guide better for planning and the Lonely Planet more to help while actually travelling
1	The Best Work of Wells. "The Martians have arrived. Let the war begin." A catchphrase that could easily be employed for Herbert George Wells's most acclaimed science fiction "The War of the Worlds". This is a novel revolving around the highly improbable but simultaneously stunningly imaginative idea that the earth is invaded by organisms residing on Mars. Composed in a first person narrative,"The War of the Worlds" is a gripping saga of the millions of people's agony and loss of ease in the face of a confrontation that would change the world for good.The story begins directly with the theme. In the last years of the 19th.century,in the most unassuming and delicate of all propositions,England witnesses the most surreal threat:ten bizzare cylinders all containing Martians fall near London. A wave of bitter agony,nameless fear and hopeless apprehension rocks the peole and as the Martians gradually come to terms with the Earth's gravitational strength,the police and the military of surrounding regions stolidly enarm themselves for an imminent war. The greatest of all human fallacies is perhaps the absurd universal acknowledgement that humans are the most accomplished creatures anywhere. This myth is firmly exploited in the book a the narrator---an ardent follower of astronomy and scholar of philosophy---perceives a plethora of harrowing incidents that compel him to shudder to his boots.The narrator's town of Maybury is completely demolished and so are the nearby towns of Woking,Weybridge,Shepperton and others. The narrator manages to traffic his wife to his cousin's place in Leatherhead in asumed safety but himself gets entangled hopelessly and helplessly in the boughs of life and death. In his maddening and desperate escape from the clutches of the more intelligent and powerful Martians,the narrator pairs up first with an artillerman and then with a curate. The latter is a lost soul whose faith in God and religion has broken in the wake of humanity's greatest ever calamity and the former is confident and visonery whose preferred modes of survival in a Martian dominated Earth is not that improbable,if at all naive. H.G.Wells's artistry lies in speedily building up to a great climax and in a plot so utterly novel and unique and symmetrical,this is a marvellous diusplay of wit,intelligence and clearness of structure."The War of the Worlds" on one level may appear to be a mere science fiction with vivid illustration of beings from outer space and the havoc they cause on our planet but the essence of the book transcends much beyond this demarcation. The weahness of mankind in the face of unknown,unheard and unthought catatrophes is firmly delineated in this landmark novel and Wells applies a very,very subtle satire on humans' grotesque complacency on teir own abilities. When the artilleryman admits,"we're down;we're beat" with "absolute conviction",the reader fathoms the author's surrender of "the greatest power in the world" to Fate. On a much higher level,"The War of the Worlds" is a massive comment on man's petty as well as magnanimous follies garbed in a dress of science fiction.Composed in a sense of retrospection,the book does lose some of its charm from the very beginning that the narrator is alive and kicking. and the confinement of the sequence of events within a relatively small England territory narrows the scope of the novel and also trims down its volume. But even so,"The War of the Worlds" is a brilliant science fictin that leads the rteader on a journey on the back of an unfaithful wave that conpires to lead the world to the ultimate diasaster. H.G.Wells was a great visonery in the late 19th.century and it's no less remarkable achievement that this Englishman's great book is still being studied today and would be read for several decades to come. "The War of the Worlds" is a captivating and telling tale that would dazzle the reader by the shine of the writer's craftmanship.
1	Anthropocentrism without the hubris. Mr. Abel was a humanist that traced his lineage of thought from the English pragmatic humanist F.C.S. Schiller to the Greek Sophist Protagoras (420-490 BCE) and beyond. "Man is the measure of all things: of those that are, that they are; and of those that are not, that they are not." Protagoras' notion that judgements and knowledge are in some way relative to the individual. This is a line of agnostic thinkers that put man at the center of the stage. They claim no absolute knowledge. This last claim Socrates did one better by not claiming any knowledge at all. Socrates is the first of the great Humanists in the West, and Confucius was the first great Humanist in the East. Humanists are proud to be human beings. Humanists' two fundamental tenets are that a man should learn to think for himself, and values are uniquely human--man is the measure. Though a little too manthropocentric an approach to our specie's place in the Cosmos for my liking Abel nevertheless does manage to make me feel good about being human. I matter. Abel's pride does not seem to me to be the false pride of hubris. Rather he seems a very dignified human being that represents us well. I am sorry ladies, but you will just have to keep being patient with us men. I assure you when Abel says man he means mankind, men and women.With the above said Abel's "Man is the Measure" is a cordial invitation from a humanist perspective addressed to all human beings in regards to the central problems of philosophy. He believes in humanity, in our capacity to grow. The one and the many are invited to join in the philosophical debates. "Man is the Measure" is written with a friendly tone and in an elegantly simple manner. It is a very thorough outline of philosophical history, and you may join in if you like. Abel is to be congratulated for his ecumenical approach to truth. This is a very good place for those with a curious mind to begin or continue their examined life.
1	I FELL IN LOVE WITH SILENT PICTURES FROM THIS BOOK. When I first read the hardback version of this book back in the 1970's in film school, I fell in love with silent pictures. Kevin Brownlow's writing enabled me to visualize films I had never seen, and feel like I was there when American cinema was being birthed. His descriptions of films like Douglas Fairbanks' Robin Hood caused me to search for decades for copies of these films, just so I could glimpse the breathtaking beauty he describes. I wished I had been born during that era so I could have been a part of that "parade."Unfortunately, as happens with most things that are overly romanticized, one day I really was able to see Robin Hood when it finally came out on DVD. It had been fully restored and was a perfect representation of the original. I was gravely disappointed by what I saw.When I read Brownlow's descriptions of "tinting," I had visualized the kind of tinting that is done in still photography, which looks delicate and subtle. I thought of Broken Blossoms in those tones, and could only imagine how beautiful it was. Unfortunately, in the silent era, what they called tinting is what we today would call adding a color filter. When they wanted a night scene, they cast it in blue; when it was dawn, they made it yellow; when it was sunset, they made it orange; etc. I'm not talking about a subtle hint of color - I'm talking about one strong color that covered the whole screen. I was shocked by this technique, because I thought it destroyed the photography.His description of the music of the era was that it was something wonderful. The music in Robin Hood is repetitive and never-ending. I found myself longing for a break from it; but it never occurred.He describes Fairbank's acting as superb; I found it overly theatrical and almost carnivalesque. He was certainly athletic; but he carries it to the extreme of almost seeming like a circus performer, rather than an actor. Other aspects were equally disappointing.I know that the silent era laid the foundation upon which our entire modern movie industry - art and science alike - was built. I fully appreciate the contributions of all the talented people who came before. But it was, after all, only a beginning, and not the parade - certainly not the golden era - that those who lived then would have us believe. I think that Sunset Boulevard adequately depicts the delusions with which many of the tarnished stars of that era lived.I appreciate Mr. Brownlow's writing, which is very entertaining and interesting. There is no question that the photographs in his book are authentic and wonderful - almost better than the films they depict. There is not even a question that the era he describes was anything but astounding. But he does present it in a very romanticized light, and it does cause one to long for something that probably never existed, at least not in that idyllic form.Nevertheless, I still believe this book to be the most definitive work on the silent era in motion pictures.Waitsel Smit
1	Best bedtime book!. Very sweet & relaxing.  I've read it almost every for the last year.  Calming & sweet, before they understand animals.  Fun after they start learning about animals, babies & parents.
1	An American Classic. This work is vastly different from "One Flew Over" but only in positive ways. It is complex and intricate, powerful and emotive. Kesey's simultaneous usage of multiple voices is awkward initially but smoothes over time. The best way to approach "Sometimes" is to read it once and then immediately begin anew and read it again. On the second time through all the voice interruptions will make sense and your comphrehension of the novel will be therefore more complete. I highly recommend this work to any serious fan of American literature and though it is a somewhat difficult read it is ultimately very fulfilling
1	Brilliant or Real Horrorshow as Alex would say. You would think that it would be impossible to write a book about a 15-year old rapist/murderer and somehow have him come out as a sympathetic character.  Burgess has achieved that remarkable feat in this book.  The genius of it is in the use of the first person and in the use of slang to give voice to Alex.   The slang also serves to make the violence almost comical as instead of kicking someone in the mouth, Alex describes giving a tolchok into the rot and knocking out a few zoobies.  So even though the book is full of violence and rape, the language removes us from it in such a way that the book feels less violent than it is.  Although this may seem like it would make the book hard to read, it all makes sense when read in context.The story itself is a fairly simple and fast read.  If you have seen the movie then (other than the last chapter) you know what happens in the book.  Alex and his friends commit violent crimes, Alex gets arrested, he gets cured of his violence and then gets cured of the cure.  The movie follows the book almost exactly.  The key difference is that the original American edition left out the last chapter (the American publisher thought it was a sellout as Burgess explains in the introduction) and Kubrick followed the American edition of the book.  Is the last chapter a sellout?  Does it cheapen the book?  I think it changes the story to some extent.  Burgess suggested that it changed the book from a fantasy into a novel.  I think this overstates it but if you have read the American edition without the last chapter then you need to read it again with the last chapter.The book is a classic and should be required reading.  Although adult in concept and story line, anyone old enough to read the daily paper is old enough to read this book.  Beneath all the violence in the book, Burgess is trying to make a point about free will and what it means to be human but he doesn't overstate it.  The story and the language carry the reader and the message is just there to do with as you please.  As Burgess says in the introduction, "Eat this sweetish segment or spit it out.  You are free.
1	Emotions plus a desire to interact plus evolution = language. When asked to cite what he believed but couldn't prove, Dan Dennett responded by saying that language was required for consciousness.Interestingly Dennett's view easily harmonizes with strong trends in contemporary wisdom.  The larger view is that there is something particular and special about humans and their capacity for language that is materially different than what evolutionarily has preceded them.This book is a breath of fresh air for its helpful insight that humans are not materially different from what preceded them just more articulated in their thought processes and means of communicating them.In seriatim the book traces infant development for the capacity of spoken language and compares that developing capacity with different species of animals within the animal kingdom.  In a way, it's kind of reminiscent of the old medical school "ontogeny recapitulates philogeny."  For those lucky enough not to have experienced medical school, the famous saying refers to the similarity between developmental stages of an unborn fetus and the various lifeforms in the animal kingdom.  For example, the fertilized zygote resembles a one celled organism.  The early developing fetus resembles a fishlike creature and so on.In this book, needless to say, the more articulated the comparison being made between the infant's developing speech capacity, the more the authors will be inclined to use a more evolutionarily complicated life form.Significantly the authors use the similarities between humans and other animals to highlight their basic likenesses which according to the authors subsist in their mutual emotive acquisition of knowledge.  In this sense, this book is like Read Montague's Why Choose this Book wherein Montague merged Alan Turing mechanistic reasoning with emotive values to create an up to date model of cognition.Again, these features are all welcome.Where I think the authors falter is later in the book when they try to apply their theories to group dynamics.  But even so the book remains healthy food for thought and welcome insight if only for the knowledge that when we visit the zoo, the animals looking back at us are really not that much different at all but certainly not lacking consciousness just because they don't speak out language
1	Journal of a Christian. I bought the book looking to know more about Bonhoeffer's theology..and ended up learning more about my own. Though at times I didn't agree with his thoughts, I found myself agreeing with the man. These letters mix profound questions with small daily details of life. It is authentic and transparent in a way that typical straightforward "theology" books can't be. There is honest, articulate, and earnest faith in these unselfconscious and private thoughts.
1	Top five. This belongs on any list of the five best books of American Indian history, or of North American colonial history. Richard White is brilliant. Read this book.
1	I would give it 5000 stars if I could. Caution: Spoilers ahead. SPOILERS!!!I mourn the end of this book, I just finished reading the last page. I layed down for a moment, the book upon my chest, holding onto the adventures and the love that was shared with me through Fitz's eyes. I got up and looked online at all the reviews, just hoping to extend that feeling. Wow, I have never been so moved by a book. I cried ALOT. The poem the Fool wrote his beloved made me cry so much I kept having to stop, because my eyes blurred so. I missed him tremendously, and I was almost angry with Fitz for being happy, and that is when it hit me. Unconditional love, not bound in any way. The Fool would never stand for my being angry with Fitz for his happiness. As much as I was sad/angry for Fitz, and heartbroken for the Fool,  he was happy for his Beloved, and who am I to judge them?
1	Rural America like you've never read it before!. This is not a typical book about a standard American suburban families!  The characters in Safety in Objects are odd and disarming.  The stories are dark, the language sharp and the dialogue is crisp.  A.M. Homes has written tales that are bound to become cult classics.  My favorite stories are "Slumber Party," "A Real Doll," "Adults Alone," and "Jim Train."  As said earlier, these are not stories about conventional families in rural America.  These stories will make you think and perhaps even offend some readers.  This is not for the faint at heart.  Holmes is a fantastic writer and I look forward to reading more work by this author
1	Amazing writing, funny yet touching and real. This book is phenomenal.  Darbyshire debuts with strong writing and even stronger characters.  Best books I have read so far this year
1	Fun and original. Call me a sucker for wild west stories, and action-adventure in general, but from the first volume Et Cetera had me hooked. The story starts out a somewhat light-hearted, but eventually becomes darker and more serious, though it never loses its fun. I personally love the comedy, and it's emphasized with the artist's interesting style and hilarious illustrations. The first thing that caught my eye about this series was the art style itself. Love it or hate it, you can't find anything like it. It's unique and cartoony, and not your average, generic manga style. No two characters look alike. One other small thing I enjoy about this series is Benkate. She has got to be the ugliest female manga character I have ever seen. She's not your run-of-the-mill, busty, gorgeous bad girl with awesome battle skills like whoa. And Baskerville isn't your typical pretty boy character that all the drooling fangirls would...well, let's not go there.If you're looking for a fun action-adventure with an interesting style, you may want to give Et Cetera a try
1	Trust. It was the kind of action paced thriller that had me turning the pages.  It seemed to pick up in pace as it neared the conclusion, from Zurich to New York to Rio.  Gives an insight into the banking world.  Not as clean as the Swiss would like you to believe
1	Second in the series. In this book Father John O'Malley discovers a dead body beside the road.  His credibility takes a beating when the police return and the body is gone.  At this point, Father John makes it his mission to find the body and discover who has died.  When a commercial developer threatens to take over Father O'Malley's mission and turn it into a recreation center, he becomes distraught and is tempted to turn to alcohol, which has been the bane of his existence for many years.  Instead, he teams up with Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden, and tries to solve the murder while helping Vicky with her drug-addicted daughter, Susan.  This book, while not as compelling as the first book of the series, &quot;The Eagle Catcher&quot;, is still a good read
1	Truly written by a family man. I too first saw this book at the public library and afterwards had to have it for my own.  This book has really given me a lot of range for cooking veggie.  Most veggie cookbooks call for things you can only find in specialty stores and yield dishes that husbands nor children will touch.  I have really appreciatted a veggie cookbook that also comments on how to get you kid to like veggie food.  It made me happy to find a pizza SECTION instead of some off the wall pizza recipe!  This is a great cookbook for veggie and non-veggie families alike as it truly considers time, taste and expense
1	A decision point has come. A Time to Love, by Robert Greenberger, is the fifth book in the Time to... series of Star Trek: The Next Generation novels, taking place immediately before the movie Star Trek: Nemesis.  The first four books were up and down affairs, wallowing in Trek continuity and occasionally telling a good story.  A Time to Love, however, is the first one that's been fully satisfying.  It is rather lightweight, but for some reason it packs a punch.  It begins the story of how William Riker, first officer of the Enterprise, finally finds himself with a command of his own after all these years under Captain Picard.  While concentrating on this and his relationship with Deanna Troi, the book also tells a great story too.A Time to Love is a short book (263 pages), but somehow Greenberger packs a lot into it.  The first ten pages are a little slow as he summarizes what's happened so far in the series, but he does it in an interesting fashion:  having Troi and Riker going through crew transfer applications, commenting on what's happened so far and how it's affecting morale.  This scene is also important as it begins the realization, carried throughout this book and the next, that Riker has to finally make a decision about his life.  He's 42 years old, he and Troi have rekindled their romance (in the movie Insurrection, but they haven't moved forward. Just what is he waiting for?  Plus, he has turned down many command opportunities to stay with Enterprise, but is that still the right thing to do?  I've never seen such an effective summary before, giving us new information even as it goes over old.  Some of the later scenes, such as Geordi's, do slow down and tell us too much about the past without anything happening, but those scenes are not very long.The characterization in this book is wonderful.  Riker and Troi get the most, but everybody else is great too.  Picard is getting fed up with the boring missions that he's been given, mainly to keep Enterprise out of the spotlight and allow time for the furor to die down.  Picard feels put upon, and he wishes for a mission that he can sink his teeth into.  The Delta Sigma IV mission turns out to be just what he asked for, but perhaps too much.  His frustration when the ruling council on Delta Sigma IV is frozen with indecision is palpable, as his annoyance with himself when he realizes that he hasn't kept on top of the situation on the Enterprise very well during the mission.  Crusher's indecision about the offer to head Starfleet Medical is hanging over her head, and she keeps coming to the realization that she and Picard will never have a romantic relationship and she must also look to her career.  In the meantime, though, she is determined to do as much to help the people on the planet below as she is able.Even better are the scenes with the various security officers as they try to quiet the situation down on the planet before it escalates into even more violence.  We get scene after scene of these officers doing their job, many of which look like they're going to end with the typical "red shirt" ending, but they don't always.  This makes the scenes that *do* contain something bad even more effective.  Greenberger writes these scenes with tension, keeping the reader entranced to know what will happen next.  These scenes also give wonderful characterization to Lt. Vale, the security chief who is responsible for all of these men and women.  Greenberger perhaps has too many times where he says that Vale would give her life for Picard, over-emphasizing it a little bit, but overall her characterization is quite good.Kyle Riker doesn't figure a lot in this book, except by his absence and the effect of the search for him on Will.  These scenes are extremely effective, with Will contemplating what barriers that have been in the way of the reconciliation of him and his father, as well as taking stock of his life.  Riker is taken on his search by one of the natives and they visit the man's home as well, emphasizing just what Riker has been missing all these years.  While being full of action and conflict (emotional and violent), the book makes a very effective character study of Will, as well as the other regulars.  I found it incredibly entertaining to read.The only weak spot in the novel (and this may just be setting up something for the next few books) is the Geordi and Data story, where Geordi has to scrounge for parts by trading with various other starships in the area like some supply sergeant.  Data suggests that Geordi become a true supply sergeant by getting everybody's inventory and seeing what they have and what they need, facilitating the delivery of these parts through a Ferengi trader.  This subplot doesn't appear to have anything to do with anything except to give these two major characters something to do.  I hope that changes, but in this book they felt forced into the story, and as short as it is, I think the other storylines could have been developed a bit more.Still, that is the only true fault.  A Time to Love flows very nicely, flying by as you read it.  The prose isn't wonderful, but it's greatly functional, serving its purpose and getting out of the way.  These are the characters I know and love, and Greenberger manages to tone the angst down considerably.  No mean feat in this series so far.  This is the first true winner in the series.David Ro

1	Thank you Mr. Peterson. As a Program Manager on goverment contracts, being audited for many different areas is a way of life and always painful. Most times these audits take up a lot of time and if we are lucky we get a pass. Needles to say, any credible tool I can get my hands on to help us through gets my attention. Lord knows I don't have the time to get certified and become an expert to get me through an audit. I need something easy to read, uderstand and not filled with fluff.

1	This one is personal. I have been reading the Inspector Banks series of books in sequence since In A Dry Season.  I suspect I will go back and pick up the stories prior to that one later.In reading the books the way I have been reading them, I have come to know the mai character pretty well, as the author had intended it.There had been substantial foreshadowing of one of the murders invrestigated in this book.  Alan Banks had always brought up the memory of his friend Graham Marshall and his unexpected disappearance in his previous books.  Robinson had brought the memory up as an example of Bank's guilt and messy history.  It punctuated his complexity as a person and how that complication marks his life so far and his work as a  detective.  As such, this book should have been the most emotional and cathartic.  Instead, it was pretty much business as usual, wich was disappointing but it also underscores the fact that there is really nothing cathartic in police work.Peter Robinson is an extraordinary writer, or else I never would have read this many books in such a short time.  His device of interweaving two separate story lines together would be disastrous in the hands of an amateur, but in Robinson's hands it is as natural as can be.  He steers the narrative easily amongst the stories and builds the tempo of the story equally until the two lines comes to a parallel climax.  In this book, the climax wasn't a real climax, it was just an ending, an explanation for the crimes.  I didn't exactly feel cheated, since I got my enjoyment out of the process of building the case and edging further into the story.  The nice moments of charater building was appropriate and it served to pull the reader into the character, made us sit notice of Alan Banks and Annie Cabbot and Jenny Fuller.One more note, Robinson could have used the same plotting device as In A Dry Season, soince both this story and that one involved going into the past to get at the truth, but he refrained.  I think it may have hurt his narative somewhatbut I also think it was pretty brave of him to lay off the same device and stay with this plotting device, just to stay fresh.In the end, the confrontation with Bank's past was somewhat of a let down.  The other story was actually quite engrossing, it did not quite supercede the Graham Marshall story, but it came close.  This whole book had the feel of an intermediate step to somewhere else.  But coming on the end of Aftermath, it was good to get into a standard whodunnit
1	A good read from both sides of the fence. Whether you "borrow" or steal from work, or have employees.  Theft from work IS happening.  Whether time, resources, or property a lot of people feel entitled to do it.  This book has tools and insight on both sides.  Even if you don't wear the "loss prevention" hat.  Employees and managers are involved and have vested interests in employee theft.  So much money is lost due to "shrinkage" - invest in your company and buy the book

1	an eye-opener. It is hard to say whether all Suzuki's facts are absolutely valid or not, especially when his discussion turns to what the Earth's true carrying capacity for humans is - but that is slightly beside the point here. The most important part of environmentalism is to wake people up and make them realize the effects that their everyday actions have on the world around them. Suzuki does this by explaining 1) how everything in this world is connected, 2) pollution of one area will invariably affect another area, and 3) we really do not understand all the elements needed for the proper functioning of the environment. This should make any person reflect on their own actions. The world's environmental problems (which in turn are deeply connected to human problems) will not be solved by governments' imposing regulations and all this Kyoto b.s. (not that Kyoto is bad... it's just a very small step and it is disgusting to see that both USA and Canada are stalling), change will only come when each individual makes sure their OWN actions do not make the situation worse. Buy organic when you can afford it, reduce or cut out meat entirely from your diet (I think 80% of farmland is used to keep livestock alive), buy local products, recycle, compost, reduce energy consumption. This isn't hippy crap - hippies never had that much self-restraint - this is about being a responsible person so that your grandchildren will be able to go outside and play without gas masks. Suzuki's book was what opened my eyes when I was 17... and it should do the same for most reasonable people
1	Extremely useful. Companies are looking for more and more business intelligence from their Web sites, both to improve their marketing efforts and determine ROI. This is a good thing. This is an exemplary "how-to" guide for Web Analytics. Extremely useful
1	An interesting look at how money gets distributed in the US. Andrew Hacker's Money is a great look at who has the money in America and how they got it. He talks in great detail about how the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. I was astounded to read that in 1997 there were 137  individuals who claimed over $1 billion in income. Almost 70,000 tax  returns claimed an income of at least $1 million. There are far more rich  people out there than I thought and it leads me to believe that if they can  do it, so can I
1	Excellent Read for All Ages~. I thought this book was a lot of fun, and very informative. We should all be so lucky as to travel the world, and no less, in 80 days but to do it in the past with much difficulty is something else.The one thing I found confusing was that the author tended to skip arond in their storytelling, but still highly recommended to kids and adult
1	If you love golf, this is for you..... I have read many of the books in the Chicken Soup Series but this one really hits home! I am a golfer and everyone who plays the game will tell you that golf is a metaphor for life. These short essays really capture the  essence of the game. I suggest that everybody start with the essay entitled  &quot;A Wing Grew Back&quot; written by Jay Gearan. It is skillfully  crafted and immediately draws the reader into the inspiring story of the  challenges confronting a handicapped golfer. I certainly hope there will be  a second helping of Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul and hope to see more  work done by Gearan. Kudos for a job well done!!!
1	Real people stepping out from an Arthurian tapestry. Like many authors, Vera Chapman tackles the daunting task of retelling and rounding out the characters of a well-known story.  Unlike most authors, her retelling succeeds because it reads like her own story.  While you know how it must end, you look forward to the fun of getting there. 	The story is the tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, in which Sir Gawain meets a challenge of almost certain death.  However, by some deft family-history work (which is completely possible to my knowledge) she succeeds in making the characters her own, whose personalities are new and whose attitudes are modern and easy to sympathize with while not being anachronistic.  	What drew me into the story most, though, was the author's wonderful use of language.  She writes in a lush descriptive style which leaves the readers with as clear a picture as a medieval tapestry.  These vivid descriptions make the pages pass quickly and make the book impossible to put down.  Luckily, the book is s! ! hort enough to make reading it in one (long!) sitting possible, since Chapman also knows how to make her storytelling concise while maintaining the atmosphere of a royal court. 	I highly recommend this book to anyone, teenage or adult, who loves to hear a good story being retold
1	An informative, entertaining read. What a monumental task -- telling the story of such a remarkable, complex literary figure.  Valerie Boyd does an outstanding job of revealing Hurston's motivations, inspiration and personal character.  I've always loved Hurston as a writer.  Reading this biography fortified my respect for her talent and sheer will to create.  This book provides a spiritual lift -- ZNH is solid evidence that creativity cannot be suppressed.  Additionally, the book is a virtual tour of the Harlem Renaissance and some its most illustrious players, and a thoughtful chronicle of the black experience in the early 20th century.  A must-read for students of African American history and culture
1	Virginia Is For Lovers (Of History). What an excellent book! The last I knew Fischer was working on a big book concerning plantation life in the south and I assume this is a book that developed out of the research he is doing for that book. This book concerns  migration from Britain to Virginia, migration within Virginia and then  migration from Virginia to other states. Most of the book deals with the  1700's up until just before the Civil War. I can't do justice to all the  interesting information that is in this book during the course of a brief  review. The authors explain how people migrated from different parts of  Britain and settled in different areas of Virginia. For example, people  from Northern England and the Scottish border area tended to settle in  southern Virginia. They brought their customs with them which tended to  make southern Virginia different from other areas settled by different  people. For instance, the Tidewater area was settled by younger sons of the  English nobility. These people came over to Virginia because under English  law they were not going to inherit estates back home as the first born sons  had that right. Different speech patterns developed in different areas as  well as different ways of cooking and different forms of architecture, etc.  The book also deals extensively with the lives of slaves and the  institution of slavery and how the mass migrations out of Virginia involved  many, many slaves being taken to other states with their masters or being  sold. When the Virginia tobacco based economy began to falter in the late  1700's the sale of slaves to settlers in other states was a great source of  income to the white people in Virginia who had fallen on hard times. Many  famous people had ancestral origins in Virginia, such as Lincoln, Henry  Clay, Stephen Austin, Sam Houston and General Patton amongst countless  others. There are many firsthand accounts quoted in the book from the  settlers so you get a real feel for the times and there are a number of  wonderful black and white photos, also. This short book is packed with  fascinating details. Thank you Mr. Fischer and Mr. Kelly
1	Awesome!. for me it is very hard to settle down with a book about magic, but this book....its like harry potter mixed with lord of the rings, its smooth, intricate and at times, hard core. I like reading the books where things you know can't make sense, in a way, suddenly do, read this book! it is very good
1	Original and informative. Pressfield presents the gritty, gory horror soldiers faced during ancient battles in a way that is both believable and entertaining.  Then, he layers macro-level politics on top of the story of fascinating individual epics to create an incredible book that is both fun to read and informational
1	An incredible translation. Concise and easy to read. Shakyamuni Buddha (Siddhartha) lived 2500 years ago and left this set of sayings or Dharmapada. Dharma means &quot;Laws, truth, virtue&quot; and &quot;pada&quot; means &quot;way or path&quot;. Byrom's fantastic translation makes it so captivating for the reader because it is concise without verbosity, easy to read and easy to relate to. Shakyamuni's message is not tainted with overbearing explanations but comes as quick and sharp with great wit and logical sense. In addition to this, this translation openly embraces all walks of life---making it relevant to both the laity and the ascetic. Purchase this book and read Shakyamuni's wisdom so that you may apply it to your own
1	Very Interesting Book. I'm currently reading Gulliver's Travels for my English class, and i have to say, what a very interesting book. I wasn't a huge fan of classic books, but this book so far has surprised me. I like how the author wrote the book to where you just can't put the book down. Sadly though, some parts can be quite boring, but the author is able to change that, and make it interesting again.So if anyone is reading my review, so get a copy of this book immediately, or else you will be missing out on something very interesting.
1	Riveting. Very well written for a historical-type text.  I've always had trouble staying interested in these types of books, however, this author added enough of The Human Element to keep me reading.  Honestly, I could hardly put the book down.  At once extremely sad and uplifting.  Definitely worth the time (but it's a quick read, I promise).
1	Short, surprisingly moving tale. Heard FOR LOVE OF THE GAME by Michael Sahara,a posthumously published baseball novel by the Pulitzer Prizewinning author of THE KILLING ANGELS . . . you might haveto dig some to find it, but your search will be worth theeffort.This is a short, surprisingly moving tale of an aging baseballsuperstar who is pitching the last game of the season . . . througha series of flashbacks, you learn about his career and theone woman he loves (but who is leaving him).The writing is compelling, and it makes you feel that youreally get to know the guy . . . plus, it has you rooting forhis every pitch and caring about what happens to him.There's a great ending, too.
1	The New Best Recipe/ Cooks Illustrated. They truly have unlocked the mystery to cooking the best of everything. I learned a whole new way to cook, and my family and I are eating better for it! Only one problem my family no longer wants to eat out
1	A girl from Lake Tapps says- a sad but heartwarming book!. Kira Kira is a heartwarming and fantastic book! It makes you feel thankful for what you have! I recommend it to kids within the ages of 9-14. I was told by a friend that Kira Kira was a great book and so I decided to give it a try!!! I don't know about u but I am a very picky reader and if I dislike even the begining I most likly won't finish! Enough about me...If you like to read sad book that send you into tears make sure you go 2 the  the nearest book store and pick Kira Kira.
1	EXPENSIVE ??- THINK AGAIN !!. This is the BICYCLE REPAIR/MAINTENCE BIBLE!!!Expensive? Think again!With the average mid price bicycle hovering around $800.00, and the better road bikes at $1,500.00 (and up)this book (AND THE PROPER TOOLS) will pay for themselves.Why fool around with other so called "bicycle repair" books which cover little more than chain cleaning/cable adjustments??The vast amount of small bike shops closing their doors & the remaining "Bicycle Superstores", who employ a new "mechanic" each week-Barnett's Manual will save your hair & scratches on your frame!Barnett's Manual will guide you through basic tune up proceedures/adjustments to keep your bike in top shape.YOU ARE NOT A "HANDS-ON" TYPE" PERSON??You STILL need this manual! The knowlage gained from Barnett's Manual will keen your eye to the "Mechanic" while he is repairing your bike!!ONE SIZE FITS ALL-IN DEPTH!!!ANY NOVICE can gain a thorough mechanical understanding of bicycle components, repairs, tune-up, & adjustments.ADVANCED!Simple tasks like the "correct" proceedure to mount a tire/tube right up to bottom bracket/headshell facing & complete suspension fork rebuilds are covered!HOWEVER!

Nice Prices!
1	A must read. A story of great courage and resolve, of working conditions beyond the pale, and the vicissitudes of the courts. Well written, in journalistic style, this is a page-turner, as well as being thoroughly researched, and factually accurate
1	Excellent thumbnail sketches of most philosophers. I would recommend this book for the  reader who wants to have a ready source of information available to him about topics in philosophy and particular philosophers that he may encounter in his general reading of books dealing with history ,social science and biography.Some of the thumbnail sketches are too brief and a few contain incorrect information.For instance,the discussion of the principle of indifference(POI) references chapter 9 of J M Keynes's A Treatise on Probability.This chapter includes a brief summary of the POI.However,the main discussion of the POI occurs in chapter 4,not chapter 9(See p.410).The discussion of John Maynard Keynes contains an error.Nowhere in the General Theory(1936) does Keynes suggest or recommend a countercyclical fiscal policy based on deficit finance.In the period 1942-1944,Keynes did analyse and support the concept of a capital account ,separated from the rest of the government budget,that would deal with the financing of long lived infrastructure( public sector) projects that would  pay for themselves over the life time of the project.Only these types of projects would be initially funded by government borrowing.(See p.442)
1	Don't reinvent the wheel... this is the 'wheel'. Our 350 member church has studied 'small groups' intentionally for 18 months. We just launched 18 groups with 150 participants. Things appear to be going very well. This manual has grown continually in our esteem and confidence. It is thorough, Biblically rich, helpful in the extreme, organized, & educationally sound. A small group leader can take this resource, and with study and effort, learn how to start immediately as an effective leader and then how to continually enrich the group's life together. A church program can choose it as a foundation and better the odds for success greatly and instantly. Highest recommendation. Thank you, Willow.
1	A Memorable Story. I am now 20 years old and haven't read this book since Elementary school.  Today, I randomly found the book on Amazon and the familiar first edition hardcover. I don't know how old I was when I first read it, but I independently borrrowed it from the library at least 3 different times and enjoyed reading it every time.  I've always remembered, foremost, the cleverness of the Dolphins and the anxiety and relief I felt every time I read the scenes with the sharks or the baby being unhooked.  I would say Dolphin Adventure has made a positive and lasting impression upon me and that every animal-loving child should read it
1	Please, someone take down Donna Di Giacomo's review. Roland Topor's book about city life alienation is one of the most brilliant pieces of horror I've read in some time; while reading it I couldn't help it but find some parallels between Topor's book and Thomas Ligotti's own "My Work is not yet Done". Ligotti himself also happens to write a great introduction to this book's main course, focusing on the differences between "pessimistic" receivers of the Novel prize for literature and the REAL pessimist writers that go unnoticed. Also included is a selection of four previously unpublished short stories and a brief gallery representative or Roland Topor's ink drawings.But please, don't read Donna Di Giacomo's review on this page; I have no idea what she was thinking while writing it, but she pretty much fills it with SPOILERS for 75/80% of the novel, laying there for any unsuspecting readers to find and I have no idea why the amazon staff that usually checks these reviews before public viewing gave it the green light.. Fortunately for me I finished the book long before finding that spoiling wreck, but others might not be that lucky, and this is a very good book to have it mercilessly ruined like that
1	Not just for the legal trade. While I can easily see this book as assigned reading in every law school class for intellectual property, it really deserves the greater readership of those who found joy in reading Eats, Shoots and Leaves. Its erudition is apparent, but never pedantic.  The message of concern for our becoming a society that knows the price for everything, but is not willing to share anything of value, is woven skillfully into the fabric of its clever teachings.  And for those folks who like a nicely designed hardback book, people who know things about fonts and book cover color, this is a great book to own new.  The University of Chicago has given Ms. Bielstein the star treatment she is due
1	Annotated Anne a must have for serious Anne collectors. Everyone who is a serious Anne collector should definitely buy this book.  It gives &quot;Anne&quot; a whole new perspective.  Untill I read it I had  no idea how many biblical and literary allusions L.M. Montgomery had used.   I found out wonderful things about the book's background, such as who  Montgomery modeled Anne after.  I also got the chance to read some of the  poems that Anne read or  recited.  The Annotated Anne is a worthwile  investment for people who truly love Anne Shirley
1	The Vatican set the stage. At the begining of the 21st century we are witnessing a resurgence of anti-semitism. This is an appropriate time to read Mr. Kertzers' outstanding book in order to understand the terible historical burden the Catholic Church must carry for the rise of 20th century anti-semitism. This is a well researched account proving that the Church cannot wash it's hands of the blood of the victims of the Shoah. The book examines Church policy against the Jews from the end of the 18th to the begining of the 20th centuries. Kertzers' research clearly proves that there cannot be a clear and neat distinction between &quot;classical&quot; (i.e. religous) antisemitism and &quot;modern&quot; (i.e. racial) antisemitism. Racial antisemitism was not a divergence from Church antisemitim but developed from it. Chuch leaders (particularly the Jesuit press) were active in the various circles promoting modern antisemitism. The Church cannot distance itself from the annihilation of European Jewry. It's very doctrine set the stage. Present day Islamist fundamentalists promoting anti - semitism would particularly do well to read this book
1	Buy the Earlier Edition. Great book, but the cover is insulting.  A pile of quarters?  How does that represent Ayn Rand's message?  The earlier edition had striking, gloriously stylized, inspiring art on the cover.  This one has a plain,  naturalistic pile of quarters to represent the vision of an idealist and a passionate romantic? If Ayn were alive, she'd read the publisher the riot act over this cover.
1	Simple communication techniques expertly explained in an entertaining package. This book describes a few simple techniques for dealing with difficult questions from the audience after a formal business presentation, or from journalists after a press conference. In particular, the author explains how to control the interaction with the questioners, formulate answers that are less likely be perceived by the audience as contentious or evasive, and how to forcefully get one's message across as part of the answer.The techniques themselves could have been described in 4 or 5 pages. Nevertheless the author manages to put together a whole book - firstly by analogizing them to the martial arts, and then by providing detailed examples from the last 40 years of presidential debates. This works out very well indeed, and the reader is left with a thorough understanding of the mechanics involved in handling these situations - based on both concepts and debate examples described.After finishing the book I really felt I was coming away with something tangible that could be utilized to my advantage in a variety of situations - both professional and personal.
1	The Ultimate Cliffhanger!. I saw the reenactment last night on Inside Edition of the night that Natalee Holloway disappeared and it was really slanted, in my opinion.  Nobody who has seen Joran would identify him as being with the blonde, American girl "with the Dutch accent."The one thing about this book is that it leaves you hanging...a real cliffhanger.  Unfortunately, it's for real and we don't know what happened to Natalee. Hopefully, someday soon we will find out.I really enjoyed the book.  I only wish it had a happy ending
1	Who are you?. If you are a classical player, you probably shouldn't be picking up a classical book with "easy" in the title, don't you think? I'm a fingerpicker, and when I get stuck in a merle travis rut, this book is a great way to get out of it. Nothing all that hard, but well presented and chosen.My only complaints are the same as some other reviewers: the biographies would be better replaced with some technical notes (if I feel the sudden need to read about Sor's life, there's always Google).  Also, wire-bound would be nice so I wouldn't have to prop up my tuner and a beer can to hold the book open
1	Enjoying this book is no accident. I've always enjoyed books about family and everyday life. I feel books that can convey a sense of reality to a reader hold far more importance and reach a depth that any other book could ever wish for. Enter "The Accidental Tourist" by Anne Tyler.I read this book during a dry spell in life when I was fed up with life and finding my life too ordered and predictable. I know you may be thinking "well, what's wrong with that". I felt a need for something more. That's when I met Macon Leary. Macon is a travel writer who pens book for the accidental tourist. An accidental tourist could best be defined as a travel minimalist. They exclude almost every chance at fun and try to make sure their comfort zone goes with them on a trip. He or she orders his or her  life and never takes a chance for fear of it being far too risky. Beginning to sound familiar???With his life and marriage reaching the end, due mainly to the death of his young son, Macon meets Muriel Pritchett. She is his opposite in every way, but for some reason he can't stop the attraction. I won't give much more away but know that this is ultimately a love story. But, it is not the typical fall head over heels kind. It shows Macon making real choices in a real world based on very certain and uncertain consequences. At the end you may say what a fool or you may stand and applaud. I won't let out which way I went.I'm sure you will enjoy this journey by a master story teller like Anne Tyler. The novel combines humor, family, life, death, love and choice in a way like no other. I hope you enjoy!
1	This book saved my life!. I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her.When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion.  Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life.  You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us.  But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people.While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels.  Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one
1	Best book on Ayurveda I've ever read. I picked up Essential Ayurveda on a whim at a natural foods store when I was really looking for something else. What attracted me was the simple recipes and the pleasant, conversational voice of the author. When I began reading it at home, I was so glad I had trusted my instincts! I have been interested in Ayurvedic diet for many years but felt it was complicated and hard to prepare. But this author shows how simple it can be--and very clearly illustrates how the loving, respectful, harmonic way of living with and caring for yourself flows through all of life--not just diet. A wonderful book. I think it's the last book I'll ever need in order to understand Ayurveda better. I also already have "Heaven's Banquet," which the author recommends as a great source for balanced and healing recipes. Now I'll go back to that book with new eyes
1	I laughed, I cried, I laughed louder. It's my 14th read!!!!!. John Fante-or should I say...dad.  John has made me smile and love my family so much more. I read this book again and now begin to see myself. I have every book written by John. Since 1989 I have been to California 12  times,and each time I come home I read this book . I'm still italian,hard  headed,and love my family so much more---------thanks John,   May God keep  you by his side and watch over your faml
1	A riveting read. Refiner's Fire combines a gripping story line with well-drawn characters  and a real sense of the time and place in which they live. The book held me  captive to the very last paragraph and is particularly fascinating to  anyone with an interest in Romania. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys  adventure
1	Serious great book. Anyone who is interested in philosophy's great relics but mainly reads books in English should see the Cambridge University Press translation of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood published in 1997 sometime to check the Table of Contents on pages 85-90, and compare it with Kant's original Table of Contents from 1781 on page 125, to observe how many parts of this book have become so well known that scholars consulting this monument to philosophical thought feel a need for 132 page references to find whatever interest in Kant they might have at a particular moment.  Such a summary might have been open before Nietzsche when he wrote in section 110 of THE GAY SCIENCE that "Over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors. . . .  Such erroneous articles of faith, which were continually inherited, until they became almost part of the basic endowment of the species, include the following:  that there are enduring things; that there are equal things; that there are things, substances, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in itself."  Kant was concerned with transcendental philosophy, the general problem of pure reason, but in I, Transcendental doctrine of elements, Division one, Book II, Chapter II, Section III, 3, A on "principle of persistence of substance" can be found on page 299;  Division two, Book II, Chapter II, Section IX, III, "The possibility of causality through freedom" can be found on page 535; and in II, Transcendental doctrine of method, Chapter II, Section II, "On the ideal of the highest good" can be found on page 676.Kant's practice of using large heavy type in the text for key terms makes his points much easier to locate in the Cambridge University Press edition, which features some of the heaviest type I ever saw in a book.  Page numbers for the A (1781) and B (1787) editions are located in the outer margins, making it easy to locate quotations by later philosophers who frequently invite their students to read the original work.  Schopenhauer, in particular, was adamant that Kant spoiled the 1781 edition when he removed pages 348 to 392 and "introduced a number of remarks that controverted it" (THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION, translated by E. F. J. Payne, Vol. 1, p. 435) in 1787.  This part of the Second Book of the Transcendental Dialectic, First Chapter, The paralogisms of pure reason, was originally intended by Kant to illustrate forms of reason which imitate logical thought, and appealed strongly to Schopenhauer as a basis for his own philosophy, which he declared had placed Will in place of Kant's thing-in-itself as claimed in the 22nd chapter in the second book of WWR, vol. 1, pp. 110-112.  Kant was not trying to make things easier for the philosophers who followed him by providing an easy platform they could use to proclaim their own views, as even Schopenhauer discerned when he complained that Fichte had "succeeded in turning the public's attention from Kant to himself, and in giving to German philosophy the direction in which it was afterwards carried further by Schelling, finally reaching its goal in the senseless sham wisdom of Hegel."  (WWR, Vol. 1, pp. 436-437).Schopenhauer does not appear in the index of the Cambridge University Press edition of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, but the index can be used to locate a few notes on Swedenborg.  In Gregory R. Johnson's Introduction for KANT ON SWEDENBORG, Kant's knowledge of Swedenborg's writings are linked to some of the key ideas in Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON.  "Finally, Swedenborg claims that his visions of the spiritual world do not show the spirit world as it is in itself.  Instead, his visions are spatio-temporal representations of a non-spatio-temporal reality.  Spiritual realities take on this spatio-temporal garb to accommodate themselves to the requirements of a finite intellect.  These teachings presage such central tenets of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON (1781, 1787) as transcendental idealism and the ideality of space and time."  (KANT ON SWEDENBORG, p. xviii).  The notes about Swedenborg on pages 731 and 753 of Kant's CRITIQUE call attention to his "ironic attack on Swedenborgian spiritualism in DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER (1766)" and spiritual qualities lampooned then which reappear in Kant's elucidation of the limits imposed by the general conditions of experience:" . . . or a special fundamental power of our mind to intuit the future (not merely, say, to deduce it), or, finally, a faculty of our minds to stand in a community of thoughts with other men (no matter how distant they may be) -- these are concepts the possibility of which is entirely groundless, because it cannot be grounded in experience and its known laws, and without this it is an arbitrary combination of thoughts that, although it contains no contradiction, still can make no claim to objective reality, thus to the possibility of the sort of object that one would here think.  As far as reality is concerned, it is evidently intrinsically forbidden to think it in concreto without getting help from experience, because it can only pertain to sensation, as the matter of experience, and does not concern the form of the relation that one can always play with in fictions."  (CPR, A 222-223, B 270, p. 324).For example of Kant's always already unthink fictions, I would like to suggest the experience of a rock concert, in which a crowd knows the most popular song of the evening.  It could be Liz Phair, doing a recent song, `stars and planets' in which "You know it's just the same old story.  Stars rise and stars fall.  But the ones that shine the brightest aren't stars at all.  They're the planets just like us. . . .  They're the planets that unite us.  And from big to small.  We all shine shine shine."  So we are
1	Written by a true Hardcore Warrior who knew what the hell he was writting about . This is probally the only book other than his Battle Axe book, where that you can find real case studies on what strikes and techniques work under real attacks. He details the various blows that were used sucessfully: Leopard-palm blows,half fist,ax hands,eagle claws,eye attacks to name a few. He also tells where the stikes landed and whatthe skels reaction was. His system is one based on simplicity,power and 100% ATTITUDE. He also includes his famous Tiger movement exercises, which if practiced will build tremendous tendon and ligiment strength. Get whatever reading or video material you can on this man for he is without a doubt a true SOB that you can learn valuable info that is not available elsewhere.Where others talk theory he talks reality.I am not and have never studied Kempo but feel that this books should get the recognition that it deserves. You will not find any fancy,flashy ballet type moves. They more or less resemble the WW2 Combatives of the old school that were true and time tested,(Fairbairn,Applegate,O'Neil,Styers).So the next time some pseudo tough guy claims that those chops and leopard paw strike would never work, you'll know other wise and smile inside.Unfortunately you wont find any Dim Mak, Pressure points, or no touch chi knock outs.Just hardcore,bone crunching workable blows." To be kind to you ememy is to be crule to yourself
1	The Truth About Iraq's History. Edwin Black has done it again, placing 7,000 years of Iraqi history into extraordinary perspective, reminding us of the truth and revealing the newly discovered facts to create an indispensible chronicle of that troubled land and its relation to Britain, France and the United States. That said, the book is really devoted to the last 150 years, when the importance of oil sprang upon the world and Iraq slowly rose to the top of the western nations' agenda as the greatest petroleum source of the new 20th Century. Black's access to heretofore secret oil company archives and his resurrection of forgotten military accounts reveals that Iraq has been desired by the west only for one thing: oil. This book changed my entire thinking and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to understand how we got into Iraq and whether we can ever get out
1	The Greatest. Charles Dickens: humanist, brilliant writer of prose, creator of astonishingly endurng characters and creator of David Copperfield.Copperfield is Dickens' masterpiece and it is his semi-autobiographical approach which makes the work doubly fascinating. The similarities between Copperfield and the historical Dickens- which are numerous- add a potency and extra interest to the narrative.Still, it is the wonderful likeability and absurdity of so many of the characters in DC which really make the story. Barkiss, Peggotty, Ham and Agnes are wonderfully virtuous and kind- if uncomplicated in their different ways.Heap and Steerforth- who share in common their eventual villainy- are, by no coinicidence, contrastingly complex, unfathomable throughout and misguided.However, the problems of simplicity are evident in Dora: Dickens acknowledges limits to the virtuosity of simplicity. Her downfall is nevertheless tragic, but we know it is in the interests of David's long term happiness to marry Agnes.Dickens' achievement in the book is his profound sympathy for the human condition: there is virtue in every rank, but virtue takes many forms. Moreover, Dickens shows how inextricably he perceives one's life as constructed around the lives and fortunes of those one encounters in youth. It is striking that Copperfield's life is essentially determined by those he encounters in his formative years. The most important and complex role and character is that of his Aunt, almost an eccentric fairytale godmother character, whose contibution almost suggests her metaphysical condition as a kind of guiding light. She rescues David and looks after him when noone else will. The tenuous conditions upon which humans succeed and fail are clear because of her role.The book is memorable, complicated and profound: it immortalised Dickens himself as well as his characters
1	After all this time... here is a voice undimmed.  A voice so rare it's no wonder that the life lived behind it was as it was.  Perfect voice, perfect life.  Like others here, I too see there's no need to "review" a thing like Emily.  I merely take this opportunity in this new medium to state that Emily lived in Gnosis...this is her mysterious subject.  Here is where she becomes seemingly impenetrable...until you know her terms and her Terms, and then--she stands revealed as the Mystic she was and is
1	A GREAT IMPROVISATION is a Great Treat. The brilliantly insightful Stacy Schiff proves yet again that she is, without a doubt, one of America's most gifted biographers. Benjamin Franklin springs to life here in all his complexity: Schiff's elegant prose renders his seven-year stay in France utterly fascinating. The nuanced portrait of Franklin that emerges in these pages will be of great interest to anyone at all intrigued by this endlessly complicated figure and his role in American history. I would venture to say that A GREAT IMPROVISATION is as compelling as the very best novels--the sort that once you've begun, you simply can't put down. And this, I believe, is in no small part due to Schiff's prose, which is as lucid as it is graceful--qualities much sought-after but not often found by discriminating readers. One would expect nothing less from this Pulitzer Prize-winning author
1	Democracy lost. I found this to be a fascinating book, well researched and documented. Mr. Nace traces the history of the American Corporations from the earliest years of our union. It would be easy to draw the conclusion that Mr. Nace is anti-business, but that is not how I read his position. Instead, what he is suggesting is that we have created a monster with our catering to the "personhood" of corporations at the expense of focused small businesses.The premise is that corporations have now gained more rights than human persons have in our society. Along with longevity - corporations need not die - corporations have gained other "rights" not available to people. According to Mr. Nace, corporations enjoy a long list of such rights: limited liability for shareholders, perpetual existence, virtual location, indefinite entity or "shape shifting," minimum standard of treatment, national treatment and compensation for regulatory takings (such as NAFTA rulings, etc.). In addition, we have allowed corporations to enjoy rights equal to those of people, such as: Equal protection, due process, freedom from unreasonable search, jury trial in a criminal case, compensation for government takings, freedom from double jeopardy, jury trial in a civil case, commercial speech, political speech, Negative speech (the right to abstain from association with the speech of others).Armed with these rights and deep pockets, many corporations are formidable opponents in competing with people for resources, political access, and redress of real or perceived injustices. Nace argues that without restriction of companies through the Corporate Charter (articles of incorporation), we have turned a monster loose on society which we are now almost powerless to contain. Corporations have lives of their own and little to fear from governments - they simply do business elsewhere should they find the environment undesirable. The consequences of this evolved capitalist model are that we have a concentration of power and a polarization of wealth. The most insidious result of this creation is that democracy is no longer in the hands of the people; it is in the hands of large corporations and big government which is now a big business. They have no incentive to relinquish their power.Mr. Nace does not recommend radical solutions to this situation. Instead he advocates the "more hopeful scenario in which the pendulum swings toward a softer variant of corporate capitalism. Under this course, the corporation as we know it does not radically change, but society gets better at pushing back against its influence and excesses. Environmental regulation becomes stricter. Wealth taxes blunt the worst extremes of wealth and poverty. Antitrust regulations break up the largest corporate empires.

1	Absolutely Life Changing!!. This book has been lifechanging not only for me but for many others that I am in contact with through our church.  Kris is very open, honest and straight forward with what he shares.  He uses his real life story to share his experience from going from a pauper to a prince in the kingdom of God.  This is a MUST read for teenagers through old.  Eye Opening!
1	alas! a woman to rape a man. don't get me wrong. I am very much fed up on reading stories that heroines suffer the most. well, the heroine here did suffer the most but at least in raping issues, she got the first score. Imagining those scenes will heat you up. Don't laugh.Well, I condemn rape strongly. No doubt about it. It was just I prefer this JL book than her others that also contains rape scenes. I personally didn't like her "A Pirate's Love" for that really depicted how women are so low and degradable. Read it and you will know what I am saying. At least, in here, you could be proud of what Rowena did...well not most of it....but she did fight. I also didn't like how Warrick still punished her after 3 days of retribution - a like for a like. It seems he get the most bargain between the two of them.To sum it up, the literature is good. I cried some of its scenes. Hate the rape and forcing. A woman who rapes a man....definitely a sexy and perverse thing but still not a good thing. HeY! I want to clear out that she was just forced by her vile stepbrother who turns out at the end of the story to become Warrick's vassal after saving her from falling from the roof. Geez....
1	Review by an Industry Professional. The latest edition of Effectiv Security Management is an invaluable reference for new security managers and a good tool for the experienced security professional. The book begins with the 30,000 foot view then quickly focuses on each aspectof security management.The reader gets a valuable perspective on corporate culture and the role of each member of the security team, along with good checklist for hiring new employees and creating job descriptions.The book does a good job of explaining on-the-job training and methods for discipline, motivation and promotions.The book also covers the role of security communications within the company.  The book covers techniques for managing the security department by defining methods for risk assessment, planning and budgeting with good examples. The book explains the importance of written policies and procedures and provides techniques for applying computer technology to department management along with ways to employ statistical analysis in managing a security department.There is an excellent section on relationships with Law Enforcement, industry and the community in this book.  The most amusing and insightful section was "Jackass Management". The reader is certain to find examples of management types they have experienced in the past and are likely to encounter in the future.  The book is well written and well worth the time to read.Michael Khairallah, PSPSecurity Design SolutionsCovington L
1	A really good introduction to International Finance. If the previous reviewer thought *this* was too complicated and confusing, I don't know what they'd make of the leading textbook in the field, Krugman's International Economics, which is a confusing, disorganized, and bloated mess.  In my opinion, this book is much simpler, clearer, better organized, and better written.  I just took a course with Krugman's text, and now I'm reading this to figure out what the heck Krugman was talking about, with great success
1	yeaaaa!. Bravo Bernabo! Was that how you spelled it? I can't recall. Sounds jewish to me, or something out of Edwardian adventure lit; not equally insidious but equally boring.White supremacist, then! male dominant!

1	The Classic Novel of Gettysburg. Michael Shaara's "The Killer Angels" is well known to a couple of generations of American Army officers, for whom it has been required professional reading.  It is also well known to many fans of the Civil War as the basis for the 1993 movie "Gettysburg."  It may be, with Anton Myrer's "Once An Eagle", one of the best novels on the American way of war.Sometimes fiction does a better job of explaining what happened than conventional history does.  "The Killer Angels" may be proof of that truism.  Shaara has suceeded in capturing the key events of the epic Battle of  Gettysburg; he has also suceeded in humanizing some of the principal personalties.  The reader can appreciate what Gettysburg must have been like for Confederate Commander Robert E. Lee and his stalwart Corps Commander James Longstreet, and for Union officers John Buford and Joshua Chamberlain.  We see the unfolding battle through the eyes of these four individuals and a host of other leaders.  Shaara was generally faithful to the historical record when he wrote in 1974; his story is fictional to the extent that we are privy to the unrecorded thoughts and feelings of the men around whom Shaara builds his narrative.  We see these men as the human beings they were, not the semi-mythic historical personalties (or in some cases the forgotten men) they have become.In a series of well-written vignettes, Shaara relates the story of the battle.  In one, Union cavalry commander John Buford recognizes the key terrain at Gettysburg and holds it until the arrival of Union infantry.  In another, Joshua Chamberlain defends the extreme left of the Union line in an action that will win him the Medal of Honor and enduring fame for the 20th Maine.  Confederate General Lee struggles to reorient his army to fight an unexpected battle to which his absent cavalry commander did not alert him.  In several vignettes, Confederate General Longstreet struggles against his military instincts as he carries out the orders of General Lee.  Their efforts to make sense of the chaos of the battlefield, to lead their soldiers, make tough decisions and deal with their hopes and fears hold lessons for us in the present day.  Shaara's prose is highly readable, authentic to the period, even page-turning.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and the military art.  Readers without background in the Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg may find the narrative somewhat challenging to follow
1	A Mouse Called Wolf. I thought this book was a funny story.It was funny because a mouse learns to sing and the mouse is friends with a human. I thought the story waas interesting at times because when a human sees a mouse they scream but not Mrs. Honeybee she is nice to the mouse and gives them chocolate. I think you will enjoy this book because it was very interesting. I really enjoyed this book so you should to
1	valuable book on Gorky. Lader has done an excellent job of delineating Gorky's work. The color reproductions are fair.They are not top of the line but,then very few books on Gorky have good repros. I find the back sections on Gorky's theory and his techniques interesting. Gorky states his case that he is a  classical artist. His interest in the old masters backs this up..such as Ucello.an index and these special sections help to look things up when you want to review  his ideas and ambitions for art.The paperback edition will serve you well. It is light enough to put in your kit bag and carry it with you something that Gorky deserves
1	Collector's Encyclopedia of Depression Glass. Another Great book by Gene Florence.  This book is very well organized and contains the information that a collector will want.  I recommend this to every beginning collector.  I couldn't do without this book when searching for and identifying depression glass.  Large pictures are clear, in color, and show great detail.  Lots of information.  A must have
1	Even if you 'think' you don't want to quit, you will be anxious to after reading just a few chapters. Unbelievable.  I was a skeptical, heavy smoker for more than 20 years, and I've been quit now for more than two months.  I tried and did not quit with many other methods.Allen's way WAS EASY.  I swear.  I've NEVER written a book review before, but felt compelled to share with others.  In fact, I've even bought four other copies for friends.I had no withdrawals, no regrets and no cravings.  I kept the ideas he said to keep in mind, and like magic, I quit and loved every moment of it.  He tought me how to be and think like a non-smoker again (as we all are born).  It does feel more natural.The key?  Knowing, feeling and believing (which I found out was true) that being and feeling like a non-smoker, is waaaaaaaaaaay better than how I 'though' smoking made me feel (good).  I can't explain any more than that, but it did change my thinking dramatically.He takes the way we all as smokers 'think' about ourselves and our smoking, and turns quitting into a positive.  Not the negative that most smokers who want to quit, think of it as.  By the time you're half way through the book, you are joyful at the excitement you have at how great you're going to feel when you quit.  And it just continues!AND I DO FEEL GREAT.HE HELPS YOU TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT QUITTING AND TAKES AWAY THE FEAR.Go ahead, buy it. You will be elated that you did!
1	I love this book. If you're into discovering strange records this is definitely a book to read. The book is separated into chapters. Some are dedicated to musicians and others are to individual record collectors, which are amusing. It gives them the chance to talk about the kooky records they've discovered. There's a nice chapter dedicated to Yma Sumac, which taught me things I didn't know. Apparently she had a concert in 1987, too bad I was only four. She sums up her career rather nicely and expresses the problem she had at her comeback. "I can't sing with just two musicians!
1	Answered my questions. Admittedly, I already had a feeling for what was wrong with my first screenplay, but this book helped me identify what to DO about it.  After reading two chapters, I reorganized my material and turned a bore into a page turner
1	Simple and gritty. What is so interesting to me about this book is how simple the story is. Anse Bundren is the stubborn-old-goat of a father and husband who has promised his dying, and later deceased wife Addie that he will bury her in her home town of Jefferson when she dies."As I Lay Dying" recounts the death and then trip to Jefferson, one tragic mishap after the other, through the view points of the members of Bundren family and others associated with them. These first person accounts from the characters brilliantly reveal the rather gritty and mostly unfortunate existence of the Bundrens, which appears to be the point of the book even more than the story itself
1	John Glenn was reading his own book, so I decided to save. time &amp; go with the audio(albeit abridged) version.I figured it would be light &amp; easy. Not that Gleen isn't smart. It's just that there is no pretense to the man. His stories are interesting if his delivery leaves something to be desired. They reveal little about the inner man. It is a standard, straight ahead autobiography of a man who isn't a writer. He was sucessful in several different fields then retired to do the best part all over again. Hero is an overused word today. But he a real one. That's a go. So are his memoirs
1	An honest assessment. This book purports that through the use of positive thought and mental imaging, one can change their life and character. The way this book communicates this idea is by giving success stories and briefly explaining the process itself.Here is the real deal about this practice: It works, but it doesn't usually come all at once and give people continuous miraculous results. Like any skill worth possessing, it takes persistence, practice and trial and error.People often experience much initial success when first trying out the principle of mental science (or affecting circumstance through thought and creative visualization) but they often experience some difficulties also. Its not a panacea for life, its a practice that deepens over time and through effort and study.This is a great book because it tells you that you have tremendous latent power within you, that you have access to it and that it can change your life. Well, all these things are true and the world needs to wake up to the possibilities of the inner life. What the book doesn't emphasize is that more often than not, its a process that requires commitment and persistence to acquire as opposed to a magical cure all.Even so, the beginner will see results and those results will continue as they continue, gradually becoming more meaningful,  but perhaps not as explosively as this book emphasizes through its many dramatic success stories.My reccomendation for reading "The Magic of Believing:" Enjoy its positive tone and motivational nature, and try the practice for yourself. Claude M. Bristol has a way with words and this is a great place to start learning about some really cool principles. However, also know that sometimes the real transformation occurs not through a good book and a little bit of practice, but through sustained and sincere hard work just like any other skill or field of study.The good news is, if you find that metaphysics (the science described in this book) is your bag and you are willing to put in the hours, the results will be worth it
1	A King fantasy novel. This was the first King novel I ever read as a child, and I was hooked.  Although not typical of King's haunted cars or clarvoyant teens, King is most seen in his character Flagg, the evil magician.Without giving anything away, if King isn't your favorite author (although he is mine), this is a refreshing novel that first proved that he can write using other genres rather than his horror novels.  Although King has been more apt recently to write other things, this book was the first that was not so "horrific".  It is even a great read for a pre-teen or teen that isn't usually allowed to read King, given that the book is much like the popular wizard novels of this decade.
1	Excellent. I have seen risotto prepared in many different ways, unfortunately there is only one way to properly go about the task. Arborio or Carnaroli rice depending on your choice requires a certain method to extract all of the creaminess from the rice while maintaining a good al dente texture. In this book, the author here has done a wonderful job of illustrating the proper way to produce a quality risotto. Nice photos to give you ideas as risotto leaves much room for experimentation once you have mastered the basics
1	Heroes With Wood & Canvas Steeds. What a remarkable book!  There really aren't that many stories of WWI aviation that I haven't read, so I was delighted to find this one on Amazon.  It's written with marvelous attention to detail and with a great sense of authenticity.  Often I had to pause to look up a word that has fallen out of usage these days.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are no "knights of the air" in this story, just young men doing a job the best they can.  In fact, the story's protagonist often finds himself mourning the deaths of the German airmen that fall to the British Vickers machine guns.  My only complaint (a minor one) is the cover:  It shows an SE5a in a dogfight.  Tom and his squadron fly the now-famous Sopwith Camel.  Altogether, a great read and a book that I will re-visit from time to time
1	In Search of Lost Time. George Bowling's life is pretty mundane even by his own admission: he has "settled down" into his middle age with his wife and two children, his mortgage and his steady yet uninteresting job. Frustrated, George looks back to the days of his childhood in a small town in rural England and asks where did it all go wrong? He tries to recapture those times, but can anyone really go home again?This is a beautifully written, funny and at times poignant story. Orwell depicts (with great skill) the dangers of middle-age drift, and of trying to escape from it by revisiting a past which only exists inside your head. He takes a swipe at various irritating types (many of them still around) such as the "respectable" middle classes who believe they are living in the countryside and are protecting it when they are in fact doing neither.It is interesting in that the feeling of decay, of falling standards seems to afflict each generation in turn. Although Bowling is careful not to idolise his past, pointing to the many faults of the society he grew up in, the novel does reveal that there is nothing new in nostalgia.G Rodger
1	An Excellent book tape for fans of Frog and Toad books. I am ordering this tape again for my four year old son. He listened to his first copy until it broke. It is fascinating to watch him listen to the stories with a half smile on his face as he recalls the pictures from the books. It is not necessary to read along to enjoy the tape. Mr. Lobel reads the stories perfectly. He clearly conveys the personalities of the characters without &quot;doing the voices.&quot
1	When you want to do something different... I've read the reviews for this book and can help but notice they are all 5 stars or 2/1 stars. Clearly there is a disconnect.I read this book a few months before I packed up my life and hit the road to travel for a year (I thought). Up until this point in my life my wildest travels had been traveling around Europe with my parents, a package trip to Tahiti, and many drunken nights in Mexico. Not the seasoned independent traveler. This book motivated me, and gave me a philosophy that just felt right for me. When I finished reading this I was super excited to hit the road - something that had been waning as the date approached.Well I left and my one year trip kept on getting extended. Almost five years and eighty countries later I finally arrived home again. And I still am a huge fan of this book. I carried the last chapter of the book (the ultra light guidebook) with me the entire time. I still have the mutilated original first edition sitting proudly on my book shelf (just last week I had to wrestle with my wife over my need to keep it.) I am eagerly waiting for the third edition when I will gladly re-read The World Awaits. Perhaps from the position of experience I will be disappointed, but I don't think so.In short if you have not traveled much (or have not traveled much in the developing world) and think that you might someday want to go on a trip - this book is for you. If you have no desire in traveling, and don't understand why anyone would want to put on a backpack and see what is out there - this book is also for you.If you have hitch-hiked through West Africa; gone to an airport to get on the next plane going someplace interesting; or keep your travel immunizations and passport up to date "just in case" - this book might not be for you, you've probably already developed your own philosophy and probably do not need to be encouraged to leave your house. But this book might still be a pleasant reminder that there are kindred souls out there...Peace and safe travels
1	A Gift to the Reader. Falwellian Fundamentalists and Borgian Liberals will find much to hate in this book, as will hard-line scholars who will no doubt demand footnotes, endnotes and references.As a popular presentation of the story and tenor of the Hebrew Scriptures (or Old Testament) this book is a resounding success.  It presents the Mr. Cahill's perspective on this history in a clear and even persuasive manner.  The vital contribution of the "Jews" to human destiny is plainly set forth in beautiful prose from cover to cover.
1	A very sound book. I found the seven habits to be very sound and unchanging. That is what makes any book worth while. The principles in this book will not change for 10 years to come. This book is not a quick fix and will not make your life easier. It will confirm that your life is on the right path and keep you on the path you want to travel.
1	Great coffee table book. very interesting - everyone will find something inspiring - whether you are an entrepreneur, a manager, an inventor or just looking to be inspired.
1	In a Class by Itself. I come from a background that is mostly asian, in terms of my exposure to inner cultivation.When I first picked up the book, which had been in my library for more than two years, I thought it was a book from an asian tradition. I was wrong....sort of. Many inner traditions are the products of gender and culture. What this book  does is remove all of that and get to the heart of inner cultivation......self realization. Realization that you are more than your flesh but yet your flesh is a part of your existence.Being that life is a balancing act for most people,Mr. Bardon stresses this which to me proves him to be a responsible person. To have information from a source that is accurate and responsible is rare and to be commended.The exercices are not all unique to this work but the presentation, balance, and formulation of what to do and how to do are uncanny. Many books are nothing but empty theory not based on the writers experience. You can spot this becuase most books lack explanation of concrete results related to completing the stated phase of training.Some are so empty that no real concrete training is even mentioned. Mr. Bardon does not lack in this area one bit.To sum it up. This book is for extremely serious mature people who wish to develop the awareness and ability to interact with duality beyond normal sight and sound. It is for those that are  ready to get some answers by the sweat of their efforts. All results that have the potential to lead to greatness will take time. Be patient and diligent if you decide to embark on this journey.
1	A Masterpiece. After getting and reading Primary Target as a gift, I immediately began picking up other Joe Weber books.  Defcon One, his first, was absolutely terrific.  Great plot line and characters.  The action is continuous throughout.  My suggestion is not to pick up this book to read up before going to bed because you'll never put it down.  Looking forward to reading his next - Shadow Flight.  My hat's off to Joe Weber.  Keep up the great work
1	Demo or Die!. Just bought a copy from a museum shop in Helsinki and cancelled my order. The book is well written and has great visuals. You can get it for a cheaper price from other online shops if you live in Europe. Just use google etc
1	A Profound and Important Way to Improve Your Life. I had read Dr. Ornish's books about diet and health, and found them to be very helpful.  Then, I read this one.  This is by far the most important book that he has written, because how we handle our relationships with  others is more important to our health than even what we eat and how we  exercise.  A little of this information was familiar to me from reading the  New York Times Science section, but most of it was not.  Clearly the  biggest disease of our modern culture is our estrangement from each other.   For most of history, we lived with others in small, intimate groups.  Now  that the population is much larger, we live in large groups with no close  relationships.  Even our families are losing that intimacy.  This book puts  the priorities back where they should be.  Having close relationships with  others comes first.  This book is a blessing to us all.  Thank you, Dr.  Ornish!  This book would be a great gift to everyone you care about on  Valentine's Day
1	"Dick" is a "bitch"... Moby Dick is not a fun book to read. The prose is old-fashioned, and that is partly what vitiates the pleasure (cf. Ivanhoe). Primarily, however, it is boring, plain and simple. There are endless digressions, and asides, and plot-sabbaticals. Very easy to put down. Undoubtedly an amazing intellectual feat to pull off (hence my five stars), but still...I'd estimate that 1% of high-schoolers assigned this book end up actually reading it. Can't blame them, either. To be fair, the last twenty pages, when Ahab and Starbuck have their final tete-a-tete, and Ahab famously snarls to his finned nemesis "From Hell's heart, I stab at thee!" do cause a frisson. And I don't regret reading the book...it's a great laurel to rest on, but I will never pick it up again. Eh, give 'er a go...if you finish it, you'll know that you're a man, not a boy
1	Must-read for those pondering parenthood. This book should be read by both men and women, though women are its obvious audience. The author skillfully weaves together personal experience, interviews and voluminous research. She uses these to detail women's lives and the choices and pressure they face in relationships, work and family. Her conclusions are too numerous to list, but even when the author seems to be stating the obvious, she offers examples of those who are overlooking the obvious because of internal or external pressure. The book is not quite representative because it focuses mostly on women of medium to high income, but the author does include a wide range of subjects. What I found most useful were the insights from the different age groups. It's clear that while professional mentoring between women of different ages is common, there aren't similar support relationships for women of different ages and life stages to frankly discuss non-work choices. This book helpfully fills in this gap in the conversation
1	A very pleasing read. I first read this book about 15 years ago, and have been trying to but it for many years now.  As a larry Niven fan, I first read it because of his name being on the cover.  It is unlike other books by Niven, and not part  of his 'known space' series.  If you find it, please give it a try!  It  certainly made me smile
