0	No classics, but not the worst movies ever made. BLOOD OF THE DRAGON-this is the only movie I thought was actually worth seeing on this DVD.  The movie is made just for Jimmy Wang Yu and while it is extremely cheap, it still provides quite a bit of fun.  Just like Master of the Flying Giullotine, the movie is given an odd touch with rock music in the credits and mixed throughout the film.  While it didn't work like Guillotine, it does add to the movie.  Basically Wang Yu plays a guy who has to help a kid give a list of names to a leader of rebels so that the government won't kill him.  Lung Fei plays his usualy villian role very well but unfortunately he is only a small type of henchman.  The whole movie is a build up to the final fight where a whole bunch of people come to take out Jimmy.  It is spectacular and very well choreographed for 1973.  There are also a couple of very funny parts where you can clearly see the spear not going through and just does not really close at all.  I only saw it 4 times though and it did not detract from Jimmy Wang Yu being one of the baddest and coolest dudes ever on screen.Picture quality is very bad but not unwatchable.  I give it a 2.5/5 but lean more towards a 3 than a 2.CHAMP VS. CHAMP-Dragon Lee and Godfrey Ho collaberate for an almost watchable kung fu movie.  It is very odd that I actually made it all the way through this as Dragon On Fire was the only other Lee/Ho movie that I accomplished this.  There is one really good fight, the second to last.  I think it was Eagle Han but they manage to put together enough kicks and well timed moves to make it look pretty good.  Dragon Lee also puts on a few decent kicks though like Van-Damme, he doesn't show any real power, he just sticks his leg up there.  The final fight is just godawful as they chose a pretty large guy to fight Dragon.  The villians all look as corny as normal but Dragon's master is somewhat likeable.Picture quality is kind of bad but pretty watchable.  I give this movie a surprising 1.5/5 and may have to lean towards a 2.BLOODFIGHT-this is truly one of the most unwatchable movies ever.  Yusuaki Kurata is in a tournamnet at the start at eh movie and throws some people around.  We seriously don't get another action sequence form him until the final fight with Bolo that I almost turned off.  But after spending 90 minutes watching it, I decided to stick out the last 5 minutes.  Wow I was majorly dissapointed.  If you are looking for a movie that does not explain ANYTHING, has Simon Yam as the main martial artist in the film, and has a white guy with a jean jacket and sunglasses as the main bad guy throughout the film, then you may want to check this out.This movie by far has the best picture quality on the DVD.  It starts off widescreen then turns to full 5 minutes in.  Still pretty good quality, just not a watchable movie.
0	Imploding magic. Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea books are full of magic, mystery, philosophy and intensely powerful storytelling.But you wouldn't know it by this lackluster adaptation. Instead, "Earthsea" aspires to be "Harry Potter" in a medieval "Lord of the Rings" setting, with two plots mishmashed haphazardly into one, shoddy special effects, laughable action scenes, and some seriously wooden acting.Rebellious, impatient Ged (Shawn Ashmore) attracts the attention of the wizard Ogion  (Danny Glover) when he magically rescues his village from raiders. He joins Ogion as an apprentice, but soon proves too impatient -- and so Ogion sends him to the wizard school on Roke, where Ged soon proves to be one of the most gifted pupils. But his pride and anger become his undoing, when he accidentally summons a foul demon.Meanwhile on the island of Atuan, the High Priestess (Isabella Rossellini) is slowly wasting away, and she hastily selects her successor, teenage Tenar (Kristin Kreuk). What no one knows is that the king of the Kargides is having her poisoned, and his priestess lover is trying to find a way into the labyrinth below, where the dangerous Nameless Ones are kept. To save all of Earthsea, Ged must brave its most terrifying dangers."Earthsea" basically is two books' worth of plots crammed together, but not well -- the entire tone is changed to "Harry Potter in Middle-Earth," with the plucky wizard pupil on a roadtrip with his funny chubby buddy against the forces of evil. The entire time at Roke just reeks of Hogwarts.Even if judged purely on its own merits, "Earthsea" is still a disaster -- the direction is clunky, and the special effects are amateurish at best. Moments that should have been brilliant, such as Ged's climactic confrontation with the Gebbeth, fall flat. By the time we get to the drippy, sentimental climax, the entire plot spirals into a Disneyesque lovefest that is nothing short of nauseating.And the script isn't much better. In fact, it's simply atrocious, full of unintentionally hilarious moments (a lisping dragon), deus ex machinae, a surprisingly silly demonic threat, and horribly written cliched dialogue ("So this is our destiny?" "If not us, then who?"). When Vetch and Ged dress up as Kargides to fool an idiot commander, you know the movie has hit rock bottom.It doesn't help that Ashmore and Kreuk are tolerable actors at best, but they get progressively more wooden as the plot continues. They're only saved by the greater talent of the other actors -- Chris Gauthier is lovable AND smart as Ged's best buddy, and Glover and Alan Scarfe are given too little to do as some paternal old wizards. (And Amanda Tapping has a split-second cameo)Isabella Rossellini deserves special credit as High Priestess Thar. I'm not sure what an actress of her caliber is doing in a movie like "Earthsea," but she saves every scene she's in -- she's warm, kindly, wise, powerful and devastating in her disapproval.The Sci Fi Channel tried to have it all in "Earthsea," but ended up with a muddled mess that tries to be everything, and ends up with nothing. Cliched, cutesy and only redeemed a little by some good acting
0	Confusing story line, but what I understood was okay. The problem here is the script, or perhaps the directing or the editing. Wherever the blame lies, the story of the movie just isn't clearly enough delineated to keep you involved the whole time. There are some touching scenes, some good acting, some moments that make you think and feel, but overall it just doesn't stack up.  Too bad, too, because there's some good performances here.  The only thing they did well is promote Kentucky Fried Chicken. Makes you wonder if the whole film was thought up by KFC advertising execs as a way to promote their restaurants...Guess that failed as hardly anybody's ever heard of this film
0	Great Movie! Terrible transfer... I was really excited to get one of my favorite movies on Blu-ray, but unfortunately, the transfer is awful. I really couldn't tell a difference between this version and the DVD version I have

0	Not what I expected.. Oh Leo.. why would you take this role?? I guess I can justify it since it was his early days. I rented this movie on whim. I thought this movie was perhaps a fun look at life as a teenager.. boy was I ever wrong. It was not about diaries and there was very little basketball involved. I was hoping for an inspirational story about a boy who came out of a rough neighborhood, wins the state basketball tournament, gets the girl and receives a full scholarship to Harvard, while recording these life changing moments in his diary. However, none of those events happened. I guess next time I will read the back of the movie to save myself many months of nightmares and therapy
0	tedious... If you are a casual Cheap Trick fan, don't buy this DVD. The sound quality is poor and the performances are uninspired. Even the great Bun E Carlos seems to be just "going through the motions." After seeing an inspired Cheap Trick show in person back in the early 80s, this DVD depicts a mere shadow of the former band that I knew back then. If you are a hard-core Cheap Trick fan, it won't be  total bust, but I wasn't happy with it. If I'm going to shell out money for these DVDs, I'd expect a lot more than what I got in this case.
0	Jesus, what a steaming pile of crap!. Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe
0	FFC Belittles His Own Classic By Altering The Score... Not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes, it's tantamount to watching old Batman episodes. As soon as something develops, in comes the cheesy music...The added scenes were poorly produced which is why they didn't make the original cut...The interviews seemed contrived.I'm not impressed.The older version supersedes the new
0	Attempting to tribute, copy, and mix many American movies. This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film.The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here
0	oh God, why?!!!!. I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly
0	Shoddy "Ultimate Collectors Edition", get the standard edition. If I'm not mistaken, the ONLY difference between the standard 50th anniversary edition and the "Ultimate Collector's Edition" is1) Collectible Robby the Robot replica2) Forbidden Planet and The Invisible Boy reproduction lobby cards portfolio3) Forbidden Planet original theatrical poster mail-in offer4) Metal Alloy Collector's CaseIn that case, the "Ultimate Collector's Edition", at more than TWICE the price of the standard edition, is a rip-off!The "Robby the Robot replica" is much smaller and much less detailed than the one depicted in the adThe mail in offer for the "free" poster requires a $3.50 shipping and handling fee.The "Metal Alloy Collectors Case" is made of very thin metal and arrived dented.  Not that it would take much to dent it.Save $21.00 and buy the standard version
0	The Horror!  The Horror!. Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls"
0	I love Asia Argento...but absolutely HATED this movie. First let me say that this movie DOES, indeed, have subtitles.  Unfortunately, this is just one of those annoying DVDs where you actually have to turn them on with your remote.I personally think that Asia Argento is sexy in a very skanky sort of way.  I shouldn't like her as much as I do, but I do anyway.  I think she's gorgeous and her pelvic tattoo is amazing.  I also think she usually has great taste in the projects she takes on in Europe, but her American films leave a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately, this is NOT one of her great European movies.  In fact, I think the other reviewers who refered to this movie as "pretentious" were being way too kind.While I admire what Asia was wanting to do with this movie, it comes across as more of a  PRETENTIOUS ( I couldn't think of a better word) teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy.  It's a low budget DV feature done in a pseudo-Dogma 95 style.  Translated that means the script is very minimal and the production values aren't all that great.  Some would have you believe this is for "artistic" effect.  Personally, I think that's a bunch of crap.  The teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy aspect gets REALLY old after about 5 minutes.  The lack of an interesting plot doesn't even make the more superficial T&A aspects worth watching.  (AND I LOVE MY T&A!!!!!!!)Besides the nudity, I think the only other aspect of this film I liked was the jab they took at director Gus Van Sant, refering to a fictional version of Cleopatra he would direct.  (I've heard the Italians don't like Gus or his movies.)My personal recommendation is not to waste your time with this movie.  If you  must watch this film, borrow a copy from a friend.  If none of your friends own it, or you don't have any friends, rent a copy.  If you are so absolutely obsessed with seeing this movie, to the point you just have to buy a copy, get one from Amazon Marketplace.  Don't pay more than $5 or $6 for it, it's 90 minutes of your life you will never get back again.
0	Not as good as the original!!. Once again, Hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that doesn't need to be remade.  Even with more colorful characters, there really is no need for this!  Save yourself time and watch the original
0	What's most tragic about this film . . . . . . . . . is that it's actually being discussed. I'm pretty down about the fact that I have so few ways in which to usefully spend my time that I am offering an opinion on this excrement. Exploitation of aging film stars is nothing new and if they are willing to be exploited then who am I to complain?; there's nothing objectionable about seeing a naked body on the screen, in my opinion; we all do stupid and regrettable things in our youth and they are, potentially, funny. However, certain crimes against the viewing public are inexcusable, namely the fact that WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE, SO MANY TIMES. I, personally, feel insulted that we are being offered this crud but am also aware of a sense of doom that people are actually getting laughs from the tired, old, flogged cliches (you know, sock over turgid member, lustful older woman, kooky student, BOY WHO REALISES THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS etc., etc., etc). As a final tirade and the most astounding feature of all the reviews that have appeared before is that some so beguiled by their own "insights" that they are reviewing this film in a pseudo-academic manner. I was sure the word "ouvre" (if that's how it's spelt) would appear somewhere. Please, someone, tell me that nobody has yet written a PhD thesis on campus comedy, that most banal of film types. Please!!! Otherwise, truthfully, any pretension that we are an intelligent race may as well be buried once and for all.Yes, this is a truly terrible film in every sense of the word. It is a "comedy" that is genuinely depressing but we're getting pretty used to being fed swill now, am I right? And some are becoming quite fond of the taste . .
0	Not What I Thought. I bought this movie, not from amazon, but I got it, watched it and then sold it. I was hoping for something really cool, but instead it made no sense. I like weird, I like really weird, but this was soo weird that I couldn't follow it and from what I've read I think it was supposed to have some kind of socio-political message behind it. Maybe something was lost in translation or maybe its just bad. I wouldn't say don't watch it, it has some crazy moments, but I would just say its not really worth owning. The problem there is that for most people, they aren't going to find this one at the video store unless you have a serious alternative/indie rental place. This is just my opinion though, so take it with a grain of salt, I wouldn't let you keep me from getting a movie I wanted, so get it if it looks good to you.Other options: If you want creepy go with Takashi Miike's Audition, if you want twisted go with most anything Miike. If you want violent, twisted and also some cinematic beauty go with Chan-wook Park's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. You may have heard of Park's later movie Oldboy, ultimately more twisted and very good, but I like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance better
0	" Not what I would like in a video for Christmas ". Extremely dry to watch not really humorus unless you are into very dry humor and I do not think kids are...I bought because I did not know about this video before hand it was in the family kids section in the Borders Book Store. I cannot take it back so what to do with it...UGH!I guess another unused dust collector on my video rack...We decided it was for adults... but then my adult daughter said she did not like it so I guess it is better to know what it is about before buying it
0	Blank pages. "Morvern Callar" was a film destined to cause some trouble, for a number of reasons. Of them:#1- A movie adaptation that plays loose and fast and false with the book is often going to cause trouble.#2- Whereas many high-minded films and their critics have decided subtlety is a wonderful thing, this movie has decided "If some subtlety is good, more subtlety must be doubly as good!"#3- People who watch the movie are caught between their frustration with the film'd deliberate inaccessibility and their fear of appearing ignorant when rendering judgement. Thus, you have opinions that hang around on the poles of the extremes, with very little in the middle.#4- This is not really a dog on the movie itself, but you do have to wonder about the kind of people who write reviews and get on message boards that sneer "If you don't like this movie, go watch The Fast and The Furious." As if anyone who does not like this movie is a wifebeater-wearing, greasy cinema Philistine.#5- The idea that this movie is superior because it does not, quote "spoon-feed you" all the answers. I would venture that there is a difference between "spoon-feeding" answers and being purposefully evasive and disingenuous to the movie audience.#6- Samantha Morton is in this movie. That's cause for a lot of trouble, for you see Samantha Morton is a talented actor (I just learned two months ago we're not supposed to use the word actress anymore) who has amassed a cadre of "devoted" (re: rabid) fans who believe that anything she touches turns to gold. Morton has definitively proved her acting chops in movies like "Jesus's Son," "Sweet And Lowdown," and "Code 46" but went really awry in the saccharine "In America" and the sputtering "Minority Report." Morton is a good actor, she's even a good actor for what she's given in this movie.Unfortunately, that's not enough. This movie gives her too little, or perhaps too much, to work with. There is too much subtlety to this whole movie. Blank pages for the audience to ascribe what they think to them. You can either decide that look means she's torn up inside or not. You're given so little to work with, you can't say either way. Anyone who claims to have the definitive keys to this movie I would be suspicious of as a fraud out to elevate their standing.This movie doesn't give you a key, or a lock, and nowadays that's supposed to be something to be proud of. It's not. You can make a movie in this fashion, but it needs... for lack of a better word, "meat" to it. People go and walk and do things and mess around and party but they don't truly seem to interact with each other or their environment. Emotions that I think were meant to seem complex and multidimensional seem to be totally ignored. A feeling of numbness and even inability for release would be nice, but the audience is not even given that. Halfway through the film we begin to suspect that we're being strung along, and the ending confirms that suspicion.Stranger still, this movie gives off a very anachronistic feel to it, the film quality and setting looks like it was made in 1988 or some time.In short, I don't care for this movie. Morton did a good job with what she had to work with, but in the end this film just did not do enough, confront enough, or accomplish enough. The way this movie has been structured, I believe the reviews on here tell more about the reviewer than the movie. This movie is blank pages. Stare at them, try and figure them out. Make of them what you wish. Just don't attempt to pass any of it off as gospel truth
0	Gave it 45 minutes and turned it off!. This movie was so boring and stupid, I turned it off after about 45 minutes.  Maybe I had a poor copy, but I could barely understand what Paula Prentiss was saying -- and it wasn't because she was &quot;under the influence!&quot;  I ran it back a few times but still couldn't make it out.  From the other reviewers, it sounds like it got better but, if something doesn't grab my attention after 30 minutes, I say forget it
0	One Star just to be kind. Actually not going to be kind........... What a load of RUBBISH
0	Too Self-Aware and Self-Indulgent To Be Real Fun. What can you say about "Dead & Breakfast"?  I picked this up at the store not knowing much about it other than it had a cute title, clever holographic packaging, a few decent reviews and a young, appealing cast.  I can say that the charms, unfortunately, of the actual film are relatively limited.  Pretty standard fare, really--I didn't necessarily dislike it--I just felt that it was so obvious in its intention.This film wants to be cool.  It was designed to (hopefully) be a cult classic.  It wants you to revel in its self-aware kookiness.  But that's just the problem.  Taking its cues from so many better movies, this is a self-indulgent and unoriginal mess.  The cast and filmmakers seem to be having a good time--you know this was a party set.  It seems as if they feel that they are doing us a great service by letting us in on the joke.  Well, I've heard the joke--so don't do me any favors.I'm not saying that there aren't some amusing moments--how can you fail with redneck zombies?  And musical numbers are always fun.  And the TV-ready cast will be familiar to many, even if you can't always place from where.The movie imagines that it's "Evil Dead 2," but it lacks real cleverness.  It works slightly better as a comedy than anything else, but it's hard for me to imagine anyone being captivated by this
0	Disturbing. This is an intriguing movie that compels the viewer to search for the film's deeping meaning.  I am sure that I missed much of that meaning.  However, one aspect of it is painful clear.  The crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation.  I found that premise disturbing and unrealistic.  Also, it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex.  If so, this movie could contribute, in a small way, to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof.Watch this movie if you must, but be critical of its assumptions about male/female relationships.
0	Sweet Dreams Movie. I purchased this movie for my kid sisters and I was extremely disappointed in it. The characters in the movie weren't like the characters in the shorter videos like "Strawberry Shortcake In Ice Cream Island or Cooking up Fun." The appearance of the characters were more digital and phony. They appeared to have a latex type of face and body. They also didn't sound the same as they do in the other videos.As far as the story it wasn't bad. The sleep bug was sooooo cute. You got to see the sandman and how he makes dreams. I think if they left the characters they same as they were in the other videos I would've enjoyed it more and so would've my sisters
0	What a Waste!. I bought this collection hoping it would be good...it's the same old junk they've been playing on CMT. Reba's music videos are OKAY, nothing great, and I figured that they would be specially edited or something for this DVD...but they aren't. Very disappointed. Waste of money. Reba can't sing worth beans! Her voice sounds terrible! Reba needs to get off her a** and get a REAL job instead of mooching off of these hard working country fans. Get a life REBA
0	JohnyGluebag. ****this review is NOT for the superbit version*****The 2 star rating is not for the movie, but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail, it says on the movie case its widescreen, yet its full screen, not much you can do.Can someone at Amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on?  It would help out
0	parochial and myopic. One of the most monumental events in the history of American sports, the 2001 World Series is perhaps more worthy than any other sports topic of a comprehensive, informed and inspired film document. This film is not that document.The premise of the filmmakers is that the New York Yankees, because they chose to play after September 11 rather than abandoning the season, should be regarded as saints. They then maintain that it was the patriotic duty of the Yankees' opponents to roll over and lose in order to improve the moods of their non-playing interview subjects (all New Yorkers). Meanwhile, the players responsible for the most courageous and inspiring performance in baseball history are cast as villains, and the city that experienced the greatest moment of sports-inspired civic pride in American history is ignored.Here are three reasons why this World Series will be talked about in 2051 that were barely, if it all, talked about in this movie:1. There has never been a greater contrast in the backgrounds of the two participants in a professional sports championship: the most celebrated, decorated team in American sports history against one that was only playing its fourth season. The Yankees were fielding teams when Arizona was not even a state! I would make the argument that not only was this the most important event in Arizona SPORTS history, but by way of having so little traditionally defined history, this was the biggest thing ever to happen in Arizona period!2. By virtue of becoming the first pitcher to win three games in one series since Mickey Lolich, Randy Johnson became the unchallenged star of the series. The most spectacular pitching performer since Nolan Ryan, this series marked his transformation from star to legend. While it's unfortunate that he did not make himself available for interviews that is no reason to be giving him passing mentions instead of prominent ones.3. There is no more magical moment in sports than a bottom-of-the-ninth come from behind rally by the home team to win the seventh game of a World Series. What will place this in the realm of the greatest sports legends is that it occurred in the context of a blown save by the greatest relief pitcher in the history of the game.For Pete's (and Pinnacle Peak's) sake let's all hope that fans from both of these cities someday get the film about this series that they deserve.
0	Denise Richards Strikes out. A bad movie. Not even if Denise had been nude, it still would have been bad
0	disappointing. i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing
0	The Tyler Pery Collection. I ordered these, and several other movies from the Tyler Perry Collection, only to find that they were not actual movies but on-stage plays. I returned them and was charged a high restocking fee. Not OK! No where in the description was mention of them being stage plays. I will order my CD's and DVD's from another source in the future.
0	Disappointing Second Set. With the exception of disc# 6 this collection was very disappointing.  It was obvious that the show lost its charm after season #3 and was well on its way out before Paul Reubens little incident.   However, if you liked Pee-Wee Herman the first collection under Playhouse#1 is excellent.  It was fresh and innovative.  My 3 year old loves the first 6 discs.  Disc #7 to disc #10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase.  They should have included disc #6 with the first set.  Anything after that was simply not entertaining.  The quality of all the discs still is excellent.
0	Selma Blair gets some interracial lovin'. That's the only good thing about this movie. Well, also her dialogue during the aforementioned scene is great. Otherwise this is just shock-value schlock cinema posing as "controversial art.
0	What a snooze fest. Legally Blonde 2 - Red, White & Blonde is a very disapponting sequel to the blockbuster hit 2001, Legally Blonde. I love the original so much but the this one is slow, boring, has a stupid premise, and Reese looks like she hated filming this movie. All the magic is gone, people still treat Elle like she is an idiot. Sally Field's character is heartless and cold as well, Luke Wilson makes a brief apparance as Elle's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end. This sequel focuses on Animal Rights in Washington D.C. Elle worries about the safety of her dog, the adorable Bruiser but I just couldn't get in to the story or new characters. Poor Reese, she is a wonderful actress, but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on. Forget this film, buy the original instead.
0	They made Punk look BORING.... This volume is so hit or miss it's just insane.  I thoroughly enjoyed the coverage on early rock 'n roll, but after those first two episodes it seemed like the writers just didn't know what they wanted to say.What's really odd is that this "rockumentary" missed some fairly important stuff.  For instance they only covered The Beatle's early years, when they were just a straight ahead rock and roll band.  Granted, I hate the Beatle's later experimental garbage but still, I recognize it's significance to rock and roll and the huge influence it had on many other bands, who chose to, likewise, produce experimental garbage.  Instead the documentary bipassed the Beatle's mid and later years entirely and went straight to American dirty-hippie rock.And despite many interviews where Pete Townshend discussed rock music The Who themselves got shortchanged badly.Weirdest of all was how dreadfully boring they made the history of punk rock.  In that episode, they talked to Patti Smith and showed footage of her for about 15 minutes of the hour documentary only to hit on the Clash for about 3!  And they interviewed Sex Pistol's manager Malcolm McClaren FREQUENTLY in this episode.  No one in history has ever believed a word this man said but the camera's present his interviews as straight-up-truth.  I think these writers knew nothing about punk.Anyway, watch the first two episodes.  If you like hippie music (I don't) then watch the next few episodes too, cause they were actually done fairly well
0	Read the book. Don't bother wasting your time with this movie, instead read the book.  The book was one of the best I have ever read, the movie left me wanting.  I rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through.  So maybe I am being unfair since I did not watch the whole movie, but honestly I couldn't, it just didn't do the story justice
0	I'M SORRY... I FIND THIS BADLY WRITTEN. spoilers!. Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....The script is idiot from page one.The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????Want more?In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive.Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.We have none of that here.Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth.Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk!Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel?Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!"Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great.

0	I hate framing movies. After reading the storyline of this movie, it seems like a framing movie, so I didn't even bother to watch it because framing movies piss me off.
0	This is one messed up HD-DVD. I could not get this disc to work right on either of my HD-DVD players.  It won't allow access to menues and it is extremely slow to respond.  I have a lot of HD-DVDs and this is the only one I regret buying
0	I kept watching: I didnt know they could make movies this bad. This film is so awful it will keep you watching just to see if it can get any worse. It has the feel of a cheap documentary, from the first scene it is clear that the budget is almost non existent.It seems like they rented a couple of apartments in Bucharest and decided to make a home video. Snipes is awful, his character is some ex-CIA operative who has everyone against him the only way forward is to break out those quick fire martial arts moves the we know and love. To make matters worse Snipes does Bugsy Malone style narration that makes the movie even more hilarious. One expects decent action from Snipes and to be honest there are some good action scenes and something to look out for is the ridiculous damage done to some of the bad guys, I am convinced some of the stuntmen suffered injuries because some stunts look clearly unsafe and would never been allowed to be performed in Hollywood becuase of the lack of safety.Let's hope Snipes avoids these type of films in the future
0	He's no Robert Redford. After reading the novel The Great Gatsby for school I went out and rented the 1974 version of the movie. I absolutely adored it. It showed the characters personalities as they were in the book. After that we watched the 2001 version in school and I found it to be almost unbearable. The acting was poor exspecially on the part of Toby Stephens (Gatsby). He seemed like more of a mix of Joey from friends and Boy George than a love struck man. While the hit and run scene did prove to be rather entertaining, over all I feel that this movie is just a waste of time and you would be much better off watching the 1974 version
0	Problem with the XBox360. This is the second HD DVD that I've had issues with the XBox360 player, the other being Children of Men. Ironically, both are dual format. While Children of Men refused to play, this one refuses to go past chapter 12. I've had no issues with my PS3 playing any of the Blu-Ray movies so it begs the question, what is wrong with this format? I've got another dual format HD DVD/DVD disk that I'm going to try. Anyhoo, if you're using the XBox360 HD DVD player, this movie might not play all the way for you or might not even play at all
0	Just Plain Stupid -- Actually Zeo stars. Why was this ever made? Just to make fans of the original mad? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave. When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen
0	Long and Bleak. As indignity upon indignity is heaped on our protagonist, one gets a distinct whiff of self-loathing if not actual homophobia in this depiction of a young gay man's exploitation in the big city. Mandragora is way too long, relentlessly bleak and only has a couple of novel cinematic tricks to spark a bit of interest
0	This Waiting Waiting Waiting is Tough. At the end of this film Gene Hackman's character, strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle, finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug. This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way.While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-"Unforgiven."  A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat.Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of "Rear Window." As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2
0	Baseball lovers only. If you don't enjoy baseball at all, then you won't enjoy this movie
0	all the clever British humor can't save this one... If this movie were set in the US, I would've given it 1 star but the British accent, humor, and colloquialisms partially saved it...but not enough, sorry to say!Why not?  Because despite a few mildly surprising and utterly contrived plot twists here and there, this film is still built on a particularly toxic myth: the desperately lonely and insecure 30-something single woman who is made to be as endearingly pathetic as possible for the audience to root for her inevitable finding by a Mr. Right.  Here, the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby, clumsy, and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing.Almost from the first 5 minutes, this movie just reeks of focus-group-inspired audience manipulation as it slogs through the same old trite cliches and recycled TV-sitcom bits.  Was there even ONE half-original character in this whole movie?  Don't remember any...maybe because I'd like to forget this dreadful cringe-fest of a flick ASAP
0	Honorably Courageous. Has everything:  a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special.  It makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes, especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board, winning their applaud as well.  This is a don't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout...20 star performances!  Thank you for sending me a copy.  -
0	letdown. I was very disappointed with this dvd. The last reviewer was spot on in their review. If you just want to see and hear some of these celebs talking, then get this dvd, but if you want more insight as to the photos, how they're taken, etc. then don't waste your money on this
0	boring and not a good work out. This was way too slow and not challenging. I would recommend it for elderly people, or people new to working out in general, not just new to yoga
0	Depressing. The good thing about this movie is that it didn't last more than it did. Not that it's bad, no, it's a fine depressing movie. It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right-, with nice songs perhaps, well directed if you like... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there's no way you can enjoy watching this.This is what I saw: All the characters here are self-centered individuals, conceited, self-pitying, deplorable and depressing. Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start (perhaps) a new life. That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me, it just adds to his self-pity. I couldn't find anything positive in this story. Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers. Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries. The children their parents, the wives their ex-husbands (& viceversa). Death, either thru war or car accidents, plays a major role too. It seems people have trouble getting over it, looking for someone to blame it on. Then the scenes in the church... I'm not sure what they are intended for. The three main characters (Duvall, Harper and the kid) go to church; him and the kid even get baptized, but they have no idea what church is all about; to them it's a social ritual (a tradition, a superstition?). This is not a movie about faith. It's about the troubles of these guys; the lady needs a man because she's young and lonely; the man needs... he needs to grow up; the kid needs a father and some homework. Nobody cares for others, only for themselves.Honestly, the irony about this movie is that it's so realistic and its characters so phony. I understand why Duvall went immediately to make 'The Apostle', where he plays a role opposite to this one
0	Very basic. Not a bad video, but extremely easy.  I am not in great shape and it doesn't really challenge me.  But if you are really just starting to work out, it might be a good video to try
0	The Aweful. The only reaosn this show gets more than one star is because at the very least you can see that money is spent on it. the presentation is solid.however,if i wanted to watch (let alone buy) a series which is centered around a bunch of wanking rich kids i would walk around at the highschool i graduated from 7 years ago.its all the same uninteresting [...] that people escape come graduation time senior year.ive listened to scattered episodes from several seasons as background noise after whatever i was watching before it, but the show itself is aweful.like i said, a bunch of rich kids with nothing to gripe about, griping about nothing. bottom line: [...] happens. you either get passed it, or you dont.maybe my take on it is skewed by living (born and raised) in santa barbara CA which is about 2 hours north of the (real) OC, but is riddled with the same kinds of rich-kid problems.i would rather kill my time watching grass grow than sit down and actually watch this kind of dribble.do yourself a favor: read a book rather than buying the DVDs of the O

0	For this very reason, one star. I copied and pasted the bottom of this from another reviewer here.   I have not seen this DVD, but thanks to this person for not wasting my money.   For some dunb ass reason people that film so many shows do NOT GET IT!  we fans do NOT want to see a bunch of camera shots back and forth of the crowd!!  WHO, pray tell, when they are at a concert in person spends a bunch of time looking around the fans and not the show??? GET IT YET??  DOH!  simple!  Keep the cameras on the SHOW!  and DONT change from one camera to another every 5 SECONDS!  that pisses me off too to no end.   learn this, watch Roger Waters DVD in the flesh, learn learn LEARN!!!!!!!!!!The concert was recorded with many camera perspectives although Ned O'Hanlon said in an @U2.com interview that the expenses on that show were just a small fraction compared to the expenses for recording the Boston show. The spirit of the entire show is captured very well, shots from and of the audience are used very often and reflect its enthusiasm
0	This was RIDICULOUS. Someone please slap me because I BOUGHT this movie at my local grocery store thinking that it was going to be a documentary or something.  In reality, this was not even a B movie... is there such thing as an "F" movie.I do not think real film was used to for this movie... just cheap Beta tapes and a video camera 1981.  Furthermore, the only accurate "fact" in this movie was the name of the killer.  Dear Ulli, BTK did NOT carry around a picnic basket full of scorpions, tarantulas and rats to the crime scenes.  And when the "Nancy" character said "I know you... You're the dog catcher" I thought I was about to fall off my seat.  Dear lord in heaven, please do not rent, buy, borrow or steal this pathetic movie.  The fact that it was completely inaccurate, looked like it had been filmed by a 12-year old and contained non-sensical, gratuitous violence should be reason enough to stay far, far, far away from this piece of crap
0	The Brat Pack Comes of Age. "St. Elmo's Fire" is one of those movies that could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just wasn't.It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep).  Maybe this was supposed to be "The Breakfast Club - - After College", but while "The Breakfast Club" had characters, even stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez' character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film.The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly graduated from college.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, RIGHT.Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that.  Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or maybe it's just the pearls?)  Emilio Estevez is a future attorney, working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie MacDowell.  Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her.  She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other groupies.  Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of Billy Idol.Sounds promising, huh?  Well, in what is an early portend of the "Melrose Place" to come, Sheedy finds out what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love to her.  He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home.  Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus.  Moore, after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out.Not exactly "The Breakfast Club".The real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves.  With the exception of Estevez' character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped.  Their every action, every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional.  Their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that.Winningham's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy, knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was.  And yet, she still gave her virginity to him.  Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college freshman, it would be understandable.  But she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent.Lowe really had little to do with his role.  Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have gone over better.  With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him.  Nelson just doesn't seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson might have been better suited for the sax player.Moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems, mirroring her character - - but was later rehired.While the title song later become a minor hit, "St. Elmo's Fire" itself missed the mark.
0	Don't bother. Sorry I can't recommend this one.  I bought it USED (thankfully) based on all the nice/good reviews here. I don't think we watched the same film.If you don't like movies where the characters talk to the viewer, you won't like this one
0	Lousy. Did Nicholson read the script before signing for this movie? Was he broke that he had to act? Has he reached senility to accept to play in such a poor scenario?Well, as a fan, I am totally disappointed. Don't waste your money for this, it is not worth
0	Profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film. Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see.

0	Predictable and Uneven. I'm not going to write too much. If you need to hear more just check other reviews down here.From all the 3 episodes only the first one, by Kar-Wai, is worth your time."The Hand" is well done and typical Kar-Wai. Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody."Equilibrium" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin.But the worst by far is the Antonioni's episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment. The, once, great director should have just retired by now (he was 91 in 2004) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces
0	Not what I expected. This was one of the first things I ordered through Amazon, and I guess being new I was naive.  I was expecting the Disney version and got the Hans Christian Anderson version and there is a world of difference.  I felt it was my fault and did not send it back.  It came in a timely manner and was in perfect condition
0	..not the same as earlier edition, sigh!. I recently purchased a copy of this edition, having loaned a niece with children my copy from a couple of years ago (which I may not get back...but that's okay) last Christmas.  It's a let-down from the other version; the interview with Arthur Rankin (informative) is missing, the scene where Yukon finds his dream as Rudolph and Santa are leaving Christmastown is cut out (one of the key scenes deleted from the TV airings to make room for ads) again, yet the question on the trivia game on it is there.  The Destiny's Child video is okay for the younger audiences but..me, I have an idea; why not a little info and maybe footage of who first popularized the song in the first place: Gene Autry?I just ordered another copy of the older edition from 2000.
0	It's Just Alright. This movie was alright, but not something I'd like to watch again. Once is enough. I never knew Sheila E. had starred in "Krush Groove" and it was kind of weird hearing her rap and mingling with hip-hop artist. She really looked out of place. Other than that, this movie isn't anything to write home about
0	Totally unrealistic and annoying. The main character came across as gay to me too. This movie is in no way realistic. The other reviewer is right about everything. It's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns, the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick. The &quot;martial arts&quot; in the movie are weak and sloppy, there's no way that crap would actually work in real life. I don't even know why I bothered to watch the whole thing, I guess I just found the stupidity amusing. The cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie, unfortunately that's the only thing they put much effort into. I rented it from Block Buster too, they need to burn it. This movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something, like they had to make a movie to pass drama class

I mean if there is such a thing as elevatorsickness, I had it.Right- The film makers hearts were in the right place with anattempt to do something a little different.Wrong- Hey Bubs, listen. This day and age of horror..a littledifferent is like shooting yourself in the foot.We horror fans expect more now days..even from grade Bmovies.Wrong- This was obviously a lame attempt to run with the bigdogs aka: Session 9.Right- Okay everybody makes a big deal about them creepingpast that ghost. They say.."Oh what an intelligentthing  to do." What? How the helk is that intelligent?That ghost could have ghost rabies or something!Okay, I digress.See this film only if you would like to see a rubber clown explode and a dog with no skin.Other than that, don't say I didn't warn ya
0	Go with the editor's review!!. After reading the editor's review I was ready to dismiss this movie even as a huge Buffy / Angel / Bones fan.  Then I read all the other reviews and reconsidered.  Editors often pan movies I end up liking, so I thought I'd try it.  I'm actually somewhat surprised that I didn't just give up halfway through.  This movie was terrible.  The plot was idiotic, the three girls annoying, and it wasn't worth watching even to just see David on the screen.  Go with the editor's review and stay away - especially if your a Boreanaz fan!  What bet did he lose to be forced to do this role?!?
0	Its just ....ok. The first "Cruel Intentions" was highly underrated. There was a strong chemistry within the cast (obviously since Reese & Ryan married!) and the characters weren't one dimensional. Even evil Kathryn was capable of pain that Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to convey in brief moments which was perfect for that character. But Cassidy for CI3 falls way short of being three dimensional. She's just cruel for the whole film and showed no weakness. Everyone has a weakness. However, I will say that the character Patrick somewhat intrigued me. He went beyond the game of cruelty and ...well, I won't give away what happens, but I was very disturbed by it. As for Kerr, he was alright. Its not his fault his character was kind of dull. Anyway, the film is "ok". Its worth watching if you run into it on cable, but I wouldn't buy the movie.
0	redford/gandolfini cannot save terrible script. Redford is a 3 star general sentenced to 10 years, for what we later learn is sending men to die in a mission contradicting a presidential order.  Gandolfini is the brutal military prison warden, who orders the death of a soldier/prisoner, inciting Redford to lead the men in revolt.The problem is both men are cut from the same cloth, as the script poorly distinguishes them.  This complexity is useful, but not when neither character is worth rooting for.  The most telling scene is when a reluctant follower asks the ex-General if leading men is just moving pieces on a chessboard to him.  Redford answers it is, and we infer this is 'the burden of command,' his book on warfare, i.e. the ends justify the means in battle.  It is hard to become a pawn for the great military machine, when the cause is unjust or not worth the price.  Here, the men can just follow the severe code versus revolt.  While Gandolfini's warden goes too far, his justification of needing order is reasonable.He tries to get Redford shipped out on mental issues, delusions of taking command.  The problem is, Redford really does what the Warden says shows mental infirmity.  As if he cant adjust to not commanding thousands, he invents a battle.  The battle seems as much about the General's need to command troops and teach the Warden a lesson as anything else.  No real reason was given as to why his personal connections could not have fixed the prison problems, and they were already going that way as Redford met with the Warden's superior, who 'put him on notice.'In addition to poor character development, taking one step back the whole basis and execution of conflict in a prison yard is laughable.  Last, the ending is so insipid, everyone who sees it will think of 5 ways it could have ended more intelligently.  The film instead tries to make a tearjerker when no such ending was needed or justified.A great film of the evil nature of man's institutions is One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.  A great war film for moral ambiguity is Platoon.  Last Castle is a must miss
0	Not so fair and completely unbalanced - see my media scorecard. Pundits would have you believe that Fox news and Rupert Murdoch are the antithesis of quality journalism.  They even based a Bond villian on Murdoch in one ofe the more forgettable movies. Nothing gets a liberal's eyes rolling than when you say you watch Fox News.  This Attackumentary wants you to believe that Fox is biased and not credible.  Watch this Attackumentary and listen for yourself to what they are saying and draw your own conclusions.The former reporters gripe throughout this "piece" that Rupert Murdoch changed how reporters operate, for the worse in their opinion.  What actually happened is that these reporters had to work for a change.  They had to work hard, something they probably never did before.  Murdoch, like any driven person, demanded nothing less than excellence from his employees.  Those that could hang, rose with Fox news.  Those that could not keep up appear in "OutFoxed".Fox does have a bias on its commentary section.  This draws ratings.  The thing that the pundits seem to have a problem with is separating the Journalism from the Commentary sections even with Fox putting a big sign up saying "Commentary".  They are so used to their "Mainstream" liberal journalists blending their personal views and possibly slipping in actual news that they cannot tell the difference anymore.Here is my latest scorecard:  Mainstream Media:  Latest and greatest from Reuters, a major supplier of news to the always objective "mainstream media"; fired a reporter for falsifying photos to show violence worse than actually happened.  This photographer decided that his photos (or the war) was not alarming enough so he added a few more smoke plumes and darkened the overall image.  How many other war photos have been doctored this way?  On the Reuters' news page there is no mention of this deliberately manufactured garbage.  You had to go to their main page and look way over to the right side to find the story.  I guess they still have enough shame to be embarassed about this incident.The bastion of liberal "non-thinking"; New York Times has had several reporters writing stories about events that they did not actually do background work on.  In other words, they phoned in their stories without any actual knowledge of the events.  They also revealed secrets that hurt the World's efforts on fighting terrorists.  CNN - Nicknamed the Clinton News Network during the 90's for swallowing anything the Clintons had to give and asking for seconds, the only thing they were upset about during the whole Lewinsky scandal was that they wanted to be the ones under the desk.  On their online "News Headlines" section they repeatedly have Lou Dobb's column appear mixed in with news as if what he says is news.  Lou Dobb's is the paid liberal mouthpiece for CNN and everything he states is opinion not news.  You would think they would put him on their opinion section but unlike Fox they don't have one.  They think it is perfectly all right to mix opinion with news.  USA Today breaks a huge story on a massive phone tapping scandal.  Oops, turns out it wasn't as massive as it seemed and the data was given voluntarily.  Over 70% of the American population agreed with the Bush administration on this move despite his otherwise low approval rating.    CBS's Dan Rather, this is the man man who nearly wept on camera when the Republican revolution swept through Congress in 1994.  All his hopes of a liberal presidency were washed away.  He launched a smear campaign against President Bush using the worst journalistic standards imaginable.  His background investigation was nil.  People discredited this story almost instantly and yet he persisted on reporting it.  After everything was said and done he still tried everything in his power to prevent having to recant.  The editor for the Los Angeles times had to put out a memo to his people to try not to be so biased during the 2004 election.  Finally there is Newsweek, whose irresponsible reporting was the direct cause of riots that led to a score of deaths and untold injuries.  They were so eager to report the desecration of Islam's holy writ that they failed to see if it actually happened.  They ended up recanting with a pseudo apology that laid the blame on everyone but themselves.  The blood may wash off easy but do the memories and guilt remain?   That is a question the reporters and the editors can only answer. If so, that is the punishment you deserve for abusing one of the most important and influential professions in the World.  Perhaps others will think twice before fanning the flames of hatred just to sell a few more issues.These are just minor examples of how the "Mainstream" Media operates.  These are real stories and influence real events in the world, sometimes with serious consequences.  This is not the same as news commentators spouting off at the mouth about an issue of the day.  If you want more then read the book Bias by Bernard Goldberg to get a real understanding.  I will stick to Fox News as I have yet to find a major scandal regarding how they report the news.  Like any prudent person I take my news from a variety of sources and choose for myself on how to interpret what it all means.  I do take news with a grain of salt if it is coming from sources that have proven they are more interested in being first than in being correct.  CNN, Reuters, CBS, Newsweek, NY Times all fall squarely into the "dubious at best" category.All I have gotten from this attackumentary is a bunch of liberals and hack reporters whining because Fox separates the opinions from the facts,allowing people to decide for themselves how they want to interpret the news and America loves them for it.The liberals hate Fox news.   Fox actually investigates and reports on what happened; not what the liberals wished would have happened.  They show the liberals for what they are, full of $%$^.  They hated it when Fox repeatedly showed then President Clinton walking in a funeral procession laughing it up, that is until he saw a TV camera and started shedding crocodile tears.Fox news made the general public aware that the budget successes of the 90's was due mostly to Newt Gingrich.  Clinton had a disastrous first 2 years of his presidency.  Gingrich's congress would not send Clinton the pork barrel projects so he couldn't spend to excess.  I wish we had Gingrich leading the congress doing the same to President Bush.I am sure Rupert Murdoch is feeling "Outfoxed"; right now his network is ranked numero Uno as it has been for some time.  This DVD is hovering between 2000 and 3000.  I am ranked higher than it is.
0	Boring travesty of Le Carre's work. I love Le Carre and was looking forward to this film.  But what a mess!  The plot is a mishmash -- after about an hour I no longer cared what might happen to the protagonists.  Excellent actors like Ralph Richardson and Anthony Hopkins are wasted in secondary roles.  Other reviewers say that this movie was edited to death and I believe it.  Save your money.  Maybe they'll release Spy Who Came In From The Cold on DVD some day
0	Absolute garbage. O.K. who's brainstorm was this? They need two behind the ear. How can you take the phenomenal, real life story of Charlie Luciano's rise to power during the Castellamarese war, and turn it into &quot;Mobsters&quot;?!! This had the potential to be a fantastic picture, up until they hired the casting director. Instead it was turned into 21 Jump Street during prohibition. Luciano, Maranzano, Costello, Lansky etc. are doing cartwheels in their grave everytime anyone puts this in their DVD player. Trust me, &quot;Mobsters&quot; is an offer you can definately refuse
0	SUCKED!. This shouldn't even be considered a baseball movie!  That is like calling M. Night Shamalan's &quot;Signs&quot; a baseball movie because the one guy played baseball.  Not worth it at all
0	The worst of the worst. As a Will Ferrell fan I will go easy.  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Had I seen this in the theaters I would have demanded my money back.
0	I wanted to like it, but couldn't. I often like concert videos, and I usually like Irish music.  But this one was a bit dull and, more importantly, the sound engineering was simply horrible.  There is no excuse for not being able to hear pipes or drums that are clearly miked for the show.  And, often, the sound did not synch well with the video.  I'll trust the live show was a hoot, but translated very poorly into this video.  I wanted to like it, but simply could not get into it.If you want great concert DVD, try Ozomatli or U2 (Boston concert).
0	DO NOT BUY THIS!. Please do not support this release of Cassavetes' films by Criterion Collection.  Purchasing this DVD set constitutes a denigration of real criticism and suppresses the appreciation and comprehension of true art.  The troubling circumstances leading up to the release of this edition (in which world-renowned Cassavetes critic Ray Carney was snubbed and fired after his work was completed) are absolutely pathetic and embarrassing for both Criterion and Miss Rowlands.
0	Awful!. Bring back Roy Marsden!  This guy was terrible.  What a shame to ruin a good story with a very bad actor
0	Disappointing. There are way too few scenes and many are sequenced and repeated.  Not worth the money
0	Disturbing. I may have once considered this movie to be somehow romantic, like so many other reviewers.  But, that would have been during my single days or during the years of marriage that I thought were happy and stable.  However, after having my world turned upside down by infidelity this movie just serves as a disturbing reminder of the weak emotional nature of so many people who lack the discipline to be true to the fidelity they vowed on the alter.  Now I have to wonder if total reconsiliation is really possible or if people predisposed to this behavior are destined to seek happiness outside of marriage at any cost.  I was starting to believe that couples who survive infidelity can have stonger, happier relationships than they ever experienced with each other before the affair but this movie casts doubt on the cheaters - can they ever really be content with their spouses?  It's a sad reflection on the human condition.  Yes, bitter sweet indeed
0	A complete waste of time. I rented "City of the Walking Dead" expecting it to be similar to Lucio Fulci's masterpiece "Zombie." I was horribly disappointed to find "City of the Walking Dead" to be one of the most boring experiences I have subjected myself to. The zombies or whatever they are are more like mindless vampires preying on the blood of the inhabitants of the city. They have disfigured mutilated faces, but look ridiculous rather than convincingly scary. Don't watch unless you are a serious masochist
0	Liz is right - it's trash. All her life, Elizabeth Taylor has referred to this movie as trash.  She's not being modest.  She's being honest.  This movie is trash.  It's a joke that some people actually give it more than one star.  She knew what she was talking about.It is a moral play.  The moral is that bad girls get bad things happen to them.  The moral is that promiscuous sex is bad.  Gee.  America in 1960.  Bad girls can't get married.  The only thing for a bad girl to do is drive off a cliff and die, so keep those legs together, girls.The writing is so bad it's funny.  It is like The Seagull by Chekhov, a really bad melodrama.  A loves B.  B loves C.  Chekhov labeled The Seagull a comedy, despite its constant misery, or because of it.  Perhaps he was saying that we aren't supposed to suffer along with these characters; we are supposed to laugh our heads off at them.The writing is so bad that there were several times in the movie that I actually said the line before the actor did.  It was so obvious, that the next line would be such and such, that I said it before the actor said it.  When that happens in a movie, you know you are dealing with incompetent writers.One of the funniest things about this garbage is the acting of Eddie Fisher.  He disappears in the role.  He is simply not on screen.  His voice is so soft, and he has absolutely no stage presence.  He is the opposite of an actor.  His performance has the opposite of charisma.  Putting him next to an actor is like putting matter against anti-matter.  I'm surprised that he and Liz didn't explode and obliterate each other, because her stage presence is so strong and his is nonexistant.They feed you the old garbage about a poor husband complaining that his wife is too rich and that his wife's family got him a job.  Oh poor thing.  He must escape his marriage and find some pride.  What planet is this on?  That old stupid cliche.  Hey, idiot, why don't you find some pride working in a car lot, or driving a cab, instead of accepting a responsible position taking advantage of an opportunity that your mother in law set up for you.  What idiocy.  The old bull, re-wrapped again.Nothing about the writing of this trash is original.  It is just 1960 America showing off its cliches.  There are no real people in this movie.  It is utter garbage, and anyone who is impressed by it has no taste at all.  I totally agree with Liz.  Just goes to show that you can package any old trash and find some people to rave about it.She did the movie to fulfill a contract obligation, so she could be freed up to do Cleopatra.  She always hated this trash.  The only thing I can say good about Butterfield 8 is that you can laugh at it
0	We Don't Care. I was optimistic for Greg Kinnear once.  He was very funny ragging on Soap Soup.  He usually plays the nice-guy second banana in film or a man dying of AIDS.  Auto Focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960's TV icon, Hogan, in Hogan's Heroes.  The replication of the original cast is a bit eerie.  After all, these actors dress up as German prison guards.  A chill goes down my spine, but Hogan's was a comedy, which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny SS guys.  Anyhow, Bob Crane played Hogan for six years and Kinnear badly imitated.  Yes, I'm sorry to say, Kinnear is awful as Crane, which puts a damper on the bio-flick.Here's a disc jockey with semi-hip 60's patter on the air with an All American family, a loving wife and cute kids.  They live like Ozzie and Harriet in the LA burbs, going to Catholic Church on Sunday.  Crane lands his big break, falling for the trappings of fame.  Most people fall for the trappings of fame.  Read the supermarket check out magazine racks.  So all of a sudden, Crane's garage porn collection isn't enough.  Women, very beautiful, Hollywood loose-morals women find Crane and his buddy William Defoe irresistible.  The birth of the video camera comes into play.The trouble with the script or maybe it's the cardboard way Kinnear acts, we watch, but in the end, we don't care.
0	ugh, what drivel. I'm a big Mann fan, and i even enjoy his not very good non noir or western films, thunder bay for instance. a great director, but this one stinks. i can't even get up the enthusiasm to criticise i
0	"Every time a guy gets married, he gets divorced from his friends.". In the Edward Burns film "The Groomsmen" 5 males--friends since childhood--prepare for a wedding due to take place in a few days. Paulie (Edward Burns) is the bridegroom who is marrying longtime girlfriend Sue (Brittany Murphy). The marriage is set in motion by the fact that Sue is five months pregnant, and while Paulie says he loves Sue, he's also experiencing a degree of pressure and reluctance due to the fact he's about to become a father.Paulie's four friends--who are all locked in various stages of delayed adolescence--react to his impending marriage in different ways. Paulie's doubts are echoed by his brother Jimbo (Donald Logue). Jimbo is married to Julianna (Heather Burns) and he is experiencing marital problems of his own. Loser Mike Sullivan (Jay Mohr) still lives at home and can't seem to get over his ex-wife. Paulie's married friend Dez (Matthew Lillard) acknowledges that married life and children take all his free time, but he advocates fatherhood as a maturing process to everyone. TC (John Leguizamo) is the fifth male of the group--he left abruptly 8 years before, and while he's returned for Paulie's wedding, there are also some old scores to be settled."The Groomsmen" seems to be a film based on ideas--and as such the characters are 'types' who have various issues, and these issues are miraculously worked through in the days leading up to the wedding. Some of the emotional scenes are overdone and consequently do not seem realistic (TC's temper tantrum at his father's house, for example). Several overly long scenes depict Paulie and his group of friends in their part-time band mode, and these scenes come across as pure indulgence.Dez is portrayed as the sage of this group--he has the most successful family life, and so Paulie turns to Dez, ultimately, for advice on marriage and fatherhood. One of the film's pivotal issues is Paulie's adjustment to his upcoming role, and while acceptance of the responsibilities of married life and fatherhood are unarguably critical, the film's treatment of Paulie's dilemma is troubling. And this is mainly manifested in the portrayal of Sue--an extremely annoying, clingy and demanding woman who goes around the house eternally rubbing her stomach while she flexes her domestic tyrant muscles and harangues Paulie for manifestations of his commitment. The film's message seems to be that it's a good thing for Paulie to respect Sue's expectations and her exacting demands for their relationship, and that their future is all warm and fuzzy thanks to Paulie's sublime subservience to his new role. But ultimately this feel-good film seems delusional and produces only a falsely optimistic ending--displacedhuma
0	Want to waste 2 hours of your life - ignore this review !!. If you have bothered to read all the other reviews here, i think you will get the point, but still unsure ?Think of KNIGHTRIDER from the 70`s ( i`m sure EDI used the same voice !! ) then add some THUNDERBIRD puppets ( thats a bit mean, at least they had personality ) then add a dash of C.G.I. on a budget, oh and not forgetting that the whole script was written by a seven year old!A bit scathing you may feel - but deservedly so i`m afraid.Seriously, watch some paint dry for a couple of hours, at least the fumes will give you some sort of a buzz.
0	NOT SO NUTTY PROFESSOR. Yes, Eddie Murphy is amazingly chameleonic in this reworking of Jerry Lewis' classic 1963 comedy.  Unfortunately, Eddie's not totally funny in this crass update.  If you're into flatulence or fat jokes, then this movie is right up your alley.  But its threadbare plot takes second place to Eddie's mugging not only of his title character and alter ego, but also all of the Klumps as well.  Jada Pinkett is the customary African/American woman who does her best (Like Halle Berry or Vanessa Williams) to look as Caucasian as she can.  The late James Coburn as a cameo role as a hotshot millionaire out to fund Murphy's research project, and Dave Chappelle has a bit as a stand up comic who is not all that funny either.  While the intentions are good, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR of 1996 doesn't capture the manic charisma of the one and only Jerry Lewis whose mugging was more charming than obnoxious
0	Just Another Heist Movie. &quot;Heist&quot; is, well, an heist movie like so many others. This one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels. Gene Hackman gives a standart, average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates. This is a &quot;who fools who?&quot; picture, it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear. In fact, the characters themselves remain unclear, since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor. Acclaimed director David Mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity, so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless. This just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series. Dull, unsurprising and shallow, one to avoid
0	Because I can't give it "0" stars. Here's a film where all the actors and actresses know they're funny, but somehow it doesn't traslate into a funny movie. This film is far more irritating than enjoyable. Frantic disjointed and sloppy, this cinematic bomb could fall into the worst movie of all time catagory. Too many shots of actors looking smug and hamming it up after saying their lines.A pity, because all that talent is wasted.My 11 year old son found this film to be tiresome after 20 minutes.People who claim this movie is funny are probably not well
0	Not all that good. Not a huge fan of James Cagney or gangster movies, and nothing about White Heat has changed that opinion.  Lame plot, corny dialogue, and just plain bad acting constantly had me cringing.  In it's day this movie was no different than the generic blow-em'-up action/adventure movies that Hollywood has churned out en masse in more recent decades.  Hardly what I would consider to be a classic
0	I hated this movie. I never read the book, but I hated the movie. The acting was weak, the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable. Let's hope they don't make a sequel. The final straw was the Avril Lavigne song over the end credits
0	Ju Dou: Razor D. E. lo-fi remix. Ju Dou is a great movie, I'd only previously seen it on VHS borrowed from the public library and was so looking forward to this release, but sadly I concure, this DVD is as bad as the other reviewers have previously stated.  Worse than the old VHS recording I saw 7 years ago.  So bad, that it's gotten someone like me, one who never writes reviews, to comment on it.  This DVD should not be sold in the United States, or anywhere.  Unfortunately, I picked this DVD up on a whim before reading any reviews.I'd suggest you just cherish your memories of this wonderful film until a better transfer is made available.  It was good to be reminded of the story, but very sad to see how carelessly Razor Digital Entertainment handled this transfer.It really baffles me how terrible this transfer is.  A few moments here and there the picture actually looks acceptable, but then the rest of the time it's blurry, washed out, monochromatic yellows and browns, lines and dust marks everywhere, and occasional digital glitches.  This dvd has probably any bad transfer cliche you can imagine; more than I've seen anyway.Yimou Zhang is a great director, Li Gong a wonderful actress, and it was from two beautiful films(seen only on VHS :( ) that I discovered this, Red Sorgum and Ju Dou.  But heed the reviews, this DVD lo-fi remix of Ju Dou by Razor Digital Entertainment is a nightmare
0	Disappointed. I bought this video as something to throw in with my regular routine so I wouldn't get stuck in a plateau from not enough variation.  Unfortunately, the routines were confusing and difficult to follow.  It also consisted of a lot of standing in one place and shimmying your body as opposed to really getting a workout by moving.  I was very disappointed, especially after reading all the other great reviews.  10 minutes into the workout I turned it off because my heart rate wasn't what I wanted for a cardio workout.  I would not suggest this as a good workout even for a beginner
0	DULL IMITATION. Helen Mirren imitated Queen Elizabeth rather than BEING her.  This was a dull, boring movie, which gave us very little insight into the character of this woman.  I do not recommend this movie at all...I don't care what the Academy of Arts and Sciences says.  Don't bother buying it.
0	can't tell much about the movie because the transfer is the pits. from what little i could make out,this may have been good. i can't say because this is so poor that at times you can't hear a thing and the static and grain are all over the picture. the pits leave it alone and spend your money on something worth whil
0	This is a poor remake. It really looks like it was done on a shoe string budget. The football scenes are lame.  Sean's Maher's Brian Piccolo was not well done...and not beleivable.  GET THE ORIGINAL...it is worth i
0	a comedy routine !. unwatchable  !!!!!--over rated poet-- singers who sing off key---- aggrandizing this mediocrity is ludicrous---
0	Rent It......Maybe. I watched this because it has Big Gipp from the Goodie Mobb in it.  That is the high point, the movie is not very good.  If your a Goodie Mobb fan rent it just out of curiosity.  If not stay away from this one
0	Silly, Just Silly. There is only one word to describe this flick - SILLY.  Good for 10 year olds and younger.  Story weak.  Acting mediocre.  The action sequences look very "staged" and unnatural and are unbelievable.  One glaring error.  This movie is set in early California, before it becomes a state.  Near the end of the film they show an American flag - and it has 50 STARS on it!!!  Mama Mia!!  Couldn't even get that right.  The title should have been "The Legend of Zero"
0	0 STARS: In all honesty, this is a pretty sorry movie.  Sadly, I've seen worse. "The Butcher" is a low-budget slasher flick along the same lines as "Wrong Turn" although "Wrong Turn" is clearly superior than this trash, albeit, that does not say much.  In a sense, "The Butcher" tries to be a mixture of "Wrong Turn" and the the remake of TCM.  The kills aren't that great and are indicative of a low budget horror flick, there is zero horror movie atmosphere, and the acting is below average for this type of flick.  Also, much of the action, these characters (including the killers) and the storyline are all just plain stupid!!!  Very immature horror movie here...defintely one for the teenagers although I would not let me teenager watch this trash if I had one.  All of these flaws make for a movie that simply is not worth a cuss, and that's my main complaint (along with the overly-retarded ending of course-they actually outdid themselves with that)
0	poor quality. very poor audio quality. i still enjoy dan zanes songs on disney channel but this dvd is a different story. never played it again ever since it arrived and we checked it out the first day.Bought after reading other reviews, dont know why others are raving about, could be his friends
0	Nothing but wasted time. I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?I won't bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you'll have already guessed it by the time you're half way through. It's all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish.I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.Maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn't mean that we have to watch them
0	Unnecessarily Epic... After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please.
0	ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting
0	I love most of Bob Odenkirk's work... I think I've seen almost everything Bob's been involved with and this just didn't do it for me. If you have friends and they aren't complete dullards, you've probably had most of the conversations you'll see in this movie
0	Couldn't get into it.... I own a ton of workout dvd's and thought I might try this one due to the ten minute interval toning sections. I like to use these as add-ons to my cardio vids.  However, I tried the entire video twice and could not get over the instructor... her chatter was really annoying and I felt like she was teaching a kindergarten class.  I am not easily annoyed, and was surprised by my dislike of this dvd... I am definitely selling this one on ebay
0	Fluff for bubbleheads. Another lopez "vehicle" in other words people who think Jlo is the "bomb" will watch it no matter how many other fine movies are out there.It's too hard to find them. Just go see dumb jlo movie. She's "really good"
0	This movie makes a 70's geology documentary look good. Geez, with all the remakes of old horror flicks these days, I'm losing faith in horror films altogether.  This movie goes to prove a point that horror movie creativity is headed south.  The plot sucked, the acting was predictable and the pulse was about as dull as the script itself.  I'm a fan of the Blair Witch mainly because it struck a chord of truth despite it's overly abundant attempt to be true, but the brothers who made that film wasted their budget on this junk.  There are no doubt kids in grade school that can conjour up better ideas, create more realistic suspense and drive you insane with terror.  But these days, horror directors fall back on old ideas, stale scripts with added gore and one or two decent actors, in hopes that their ship might sail, bringing in a budget that will carry them over until a newer, fresher idea surfaces.  Give me your budget, throw in the towel and let me scare the s#$t out of you, because if movies like these are all you have to offer up, then the genre of horror has a fate sealed in doom
0	BALKAN BULLCRAP. Let's be up straight and honest.  There is nothing really to recommend or like about this movie.  Shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994, BALKAN RUNNER has a stiff and pondering script full of holes (like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix's claws?), a talentless cast, and a score reminiscent of a 70s cartoon series.  Daisy White is certainly lovely as is Isabel Russinova, but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga.  Paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about, BALKAN RUNNER is one of those movies you've never heard about, and rightly so!!
0	Stick with Willy Wonka. I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$
0	Horrible Audio, No Teaching. These other reviewers are kidding you.There are significant problems with this dvd.1. The audio on this dvd is horrible.  It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube.  I could have done better in my garage.2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin.  There is no teaching whatsoever.I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this
0	Defective Recording. This recording is simply DEFECTIVE.It opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording, and boy, they are not kidding!This is not a simple case of VHS quality on a DVD.  Instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing.  And the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders, complete with pitch shifts..It is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording.  Even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame.Some example frames at VienneseBall dot org slash PiratesThis is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance.I am immediately returning this to Amazon.  This recording should never have been released
0	just ok. Tyrese&Meagan Goode are the only performances in this film that work. but the film on a whole is real generic. it wants to be a modern day "Bonnie&Clyde" but it lacks any kind of depth. everything is very predictable. alot of over the top action. The Game is in this film&this should be his last film.  if Tyrese&Meagan Goode get a real script then they might be on to something
0	The enjoyableness level of Dr. Drake... This is just stupid.Now the first one I'll give 2 stars because it's so bad,it's good.But this is beyond that level.This is so bad it's...[...] BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	Stateside is an absolute mess. It's a disjointed mish-mash. Oh boy. Where to start? First of all, I was mistaken to believe this was a romantic comedy. Stateside is completely void of both romance and comedy. It also seems to be missing a cohesive story, and good direction.The story follows a young marine (Jonathan Tucker) who can't help but fall in love with a mentally ill musician (Rachael Leigh Cook.) As he spends time with her, her recovery begins to slow to the point where he is forced to sever contact. Will love conquer all? Believe me, by this point you won't care.I found the story hard to follow as the movie stumbled forward. With a story this simple, the audience really shouldn't have to question what is going on and why. And how believable is love at first site in a mental institution? "Oh, Hello. Sorry I squirt water on you from the broken water fountain... Will you marry me??" Give me a break.I was shocked to find that this isn't director Reverge Anselmo's first movie. It has "first time filmmaker" written all over it. The fault can't be put solely on the director though. This is an absolute wreck of a script, written by.. oh, look: Reverge Anselmo. Ok, all the blame falls on him.There is quite a fine conglomeration of talent gathered for this fiasco: Joe Mantegna, Val Kilmer, Ed Begley Jr, Penny Marshall, and Carrie Fisher all lend their faces to Stateside. All have small parts and try to lend credibility to the film. Ed Begley Jr did a good job with what he had. Val Kilmer however was very inconsistent. When he is yelling at the recruits he just seemed out of place. He wasn't a believable or natural military leader. However, when he slowed down to talk to the boys from his heart, he was quite good.Jonathan Tucker does a good job as the lead, and Rachael Leigh Cook does a decent job as the mentally ill musician/actress. I just never bought into the relationship.I really wish more time had been spent in the editing room prior to the films release. The story is interesting, but the way it unfolds is far too distracting to allow the audience to fall into a comfort zone and accept the story as told. The movie also feels very heavy. It really could have used a bit more humor to offset the dramatic tension caused by the marine's relationship with his father, and by his forbidden romance with his famous, mentally ill soul mate.mastercritic.co
0	A horrible ending to a horrible trilogy. I've always loved the original trilogy, but these prequals are just awful. This episode 3 was probably the most dissapointing. I had hoped that maybe lucas could salvage this horrible trilogy but he just made it worse. Horrible acting and writing really sent this movie down the toilet. The only slightly decent thing in the movie was the lightsaber scene between anakin and obi wan.
0	Ridiculous!. Didn't like it; unbelievably a waste of time and talent
0	Disturbing...Neurotic...A waste of good time. This film is deeply disturbing.  Besides being utterly revolting, this film also leaves the viewer contemplating suicide after being submitted to such utter depravity and lack of anything decent or worthy of flattery.  What an utter waste of film.  Don't waste your time or money

0	What a stupid movie. I really thought this was pretty lame movie, and in NO way a comparrison to Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction the way one reviewer described.  The attempt is to tell a story about some kid, played by Stephen Dorff, who becomes a pop-culture icon because he was held hostage and apparently didn't care.  At least thats what I got out of it.  I think what turned me off the most about this movie was Dorff's character--an "uber-cool" rebel type who's mean to his apparently oppresive father and cry-baby of a mother, slam dances and tears up his room (I guess to prove to us how cool he is), and who can get in front of an audience of high school kids and proudly cuss for no other reason then he'll know it'll get laughs.  In real life someone like that would be considered a slacker or an (...), but for the case of this movie I guess he's cool.  Anyway, my problems with the character aside, this movie just wasn't that good to begin with.  A REALLY weak script, and I swear each of these leading actors could have, and have done, about ten times better since, so I wonder why the only put in half the effort for this one.  Maybe they knew it wasn't going anywhere and needed the paycheck.  As cool and revolutionary it tries to be, S.F.W. doesn't really do anything all that spectacular. The gun battle at the end with the terrorists, as well as the movie's protrayal of the media are the best (and really only good) things about this movie.  But, most of you kiddies out there will probably like it because it has people cussing and drinking beer.  But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong
0	Stick with Willy Wonka. I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$
0	Please enter a title for your review. This is as bad as Out Cold. I think most viewers, even if they just want dumb fun, will find this movie insulting to their intelligence. I guess maybe it's just a movie to watch while drinking with friends. Your brain would have to be completely turned off to be entertained by it. It's template derived, an endless string of cliches. The kind of script that draws inspiration from other movies rather than from real life or a creative imagination. The basic plot outline of a guy making an emergency trip across the country to save his relationship, while falling for another girl in the process, is ripped off of Road Trip who ripped it off of Overnight Delivery. Only in this movie instead of the other girl being wilder and broadening the guy's horizons she's more conservative, I guess a testament to the conservative mentality behind this film. The added bit of having to save the girlfriend from a sleazy record executive type = Wayne's World. The picking up girls who subject the unwitting guy to violent bondage = Tomcats. The popsickle scene was the only remotely clever part. If it was just the girl licking the popsickle seductively to tease the boy it would be really dumb, but because the guy was doing it too it had a certain inane random charm to it that I liked.It's pretty tragic to think that hundreds of people spent months working on this. The only real problem is the script. It's a professional looking movie as far as the actors and cameras go, but it's all wasted effort because of the weak script. It's like building a mansion on a sinkhole.
0	This IS NOT a horror film, in fact it's not much at all. There is nothing frightening about weird noises, angry phone calls and a DJ who won't leave the booth even though he has to take a pee and instead wets himself. As one reviewer wrote, there are a ton of flashbacks although the most important and relevant one is from a few hours before the DJ went on the air. As he gets the weird whispers over the phone, the callers start to ask him about those rather than the topic at hand. This starts to tick off an already arrogant person and he takes it out on the callers and the staff. There is a mixture of the "horror" he committed and the slightly weird things that are happening in the station. Oh yeah, the studio is creepy because of what happened decades before to another DJ.This was not scary, creepy nor good. It was a waste of my time. Even though there were a couple twists at the end, they didn't work because I didn't CARE. There are a myriad of Asian films that deal with phones out there that are average to really good. Put a phone, a girl with long black hair and a person (almost always a woman)who will die soon if they don't solve something before they die all together and you have a winning formula for an Asian horror flick.This isn't a bad movie, it's worse than that, it's boring. Which is a sin in any movie, much less in a supposed horror flick. Even so-so films in this genre avoid.If you want to watch a mystery, then RENT this. If you are looking to be shocked, scared or frightened stay away. FAR away
0	A very long political attack ad. I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc.That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO?Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory ..
0	A slow drama, not for guys or die-hard horror fans. Ok, so I'm a half hour into the movie, and I'm falling asleep here on my couch. I rented "The Return" as part of a usual Saturday horror-film fest. The PG-13 rating was the first thing that caught my attention...however, there have been a few good PG 13 horror films, at least in my opinion (What Lies Beneath, The Ring), but they are somewhat of a rarity. I guess I should have figured that this one staring Sarah Michelle Gellar probably wouldn't stand the test of taste. So what's missing?A good horror film is like a good speech, book, article....what not. You have an introduction, a body and a conclusion. Well, we start off with an introduction. It was good, nice set-up, good acting, great environment. However, the introduction never seems to end. When you're 45 minutes into the film and so far all you've seen were a few flashy images, loud smash cuts, and eerie music, as the main character walks around in circles, it's just time to start something new. The scariest part had to be when I ran out of ice cream! In element we've gone from horror film to drama, with little to no plot advancement. Then we start a romance which seems way out of character to me for a career obsessed traveling sales-woman. If anything, this movie is more of a drama about strange stalkers who all seem to specifically go after Sarah (well, she is hott...).Reality: The film seems pretty real, all except for one spot where she reaches for a knife on the stairs after being cornered, yet she caries a switchblade in her boot...what?? Yet the rest of the film seems to be pretty realistic and the characters act somewhat reasonable.Plot: Ok, so it's not very intriguing. The story is a drama, not a horror film. Don't expect to be scared, but you'll probably jump at a few of the smash-cuts. Most of the plot carries Sarah around as she tries to figure out her past and why she's connected to this small Texas town. The creators gave a bit too much away too early and you figure most everything out before the third act. Nothing new, nothing interesting....it's just as it is. There's an interesting final twist at the end, but that's going to just about cover it. The final scene is just a simple fade to black. Everything comes together, and all is as it should be in the world.Effects: Yeah, um...virtually, there are no effects. So if you're looking for monsters, blood, gore, that sort of thing, don't rent this guy. There are a few vehicle wrecks which were pretty exciting, but that's about all the icing on this cake...Film elements; Acting, camera, lighting, sound, music....the rest is all about what you'd expect from a common drama. It's all placed together pretty well in a nice coherent manner. It's definitely a budgeted film, and lives up to hollywood standards by all means. Definitely technically sounds. A slight desaturated color scheme spills over the film's "style," and some strange quick zoom in, blur, quick zoom out type camera work adds to it. I'm not sure I particularly enjoyed this, but it's something I haven't seen to often.All-in-all, it's you average film, nothing new, nothing exciting, but it should please the drama or thriller fans. It's definitely no horror film and will provide little excitement to the die-hard horror fan. I might rent this on a rainy day with my girlfriend, but I wouldn't add it to my collection.
0	Boring porno. I give it 3 stars for porn and -2 stars for a movie, therefore, collectively; you have your single star.  By all means, I suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn, beat off, and then watch a real movie.  Caligula blows literally and royally.  It is a little under 3 hours, which seemed like 3 days, and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film.  The small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn.  The most triumphant scene in the movie is where the Roman soldiers attack the phallus-humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro.  This movie is ridiculous.  In order to enjoy this, one must be completely perverted and dimwitted
0	Do yourself a favor and read the book. A bad movie based on the best basketball book of all time.  The basketball scenes are not realistic or interesting, I just couldn't get over this fact.  Its a basketball movie with a lot of time spent on the court.  It should at least be fun to watch them play.  Its not.  The Bo Kimble cameo is the only thing that mildly interested me about this movie.  It tries to throw in several playground legends and stories and real-life experiences, but ends up coming off as a non-believable, overdone movie
0	AN INSULT TO ALL BLACK MEN ON ITS FACE - PERFECTLY VILE DVD. To answer another customer, YES UNFORTUNATELY I DID ACTUALLY SEE THE ENTIRE MOVIE FROM HIIDIOUS BEGINNING TO ITS AWEFUL END.  I DO SO TOTALLY WISH I COULD SUE THE PEOPLE WHO MADE HOW HIGH TO GET BACK THE MOMENTS OF MY LIFE WASTED WATCHING THIS DRECK!  Thank goodness a friend of mine rented it instead of my having brought this trash.I might share a movie I loved with people to a point but watching this movie was like taking a late night stroll through solid matter seperation tanks of sewage treatment plant in the heat of a still humid sweltering summer evening, not an experience one wishes to relive or share with others.  Generally I do not like druggie movies, but I have liked a few Car Wash, Which Way Is Up.  Even Cheech and Chong has more entertainment value than this critter. Oh I saw the all the black lackeys in the DVD including the Harvard token and to that I say one drop of dignity will not put out an inferno of toady stupidity. I know humor when I see it I just wish this How High had even the least little bit of humor in it for me to see.I even like a good black exploitation movie like "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" which has no redeeming attributes but it was farce in weird and stupid way that did not suggest the kind of patently negative message How High touts.I often do not go into too much detail about a film because as bad as I might find something I won't be a spoiler.  My tastes in movies and books are generally not the mainstream which is cool by me.  Even if I hate a movie I will respect the artist enough not to ruin a movie for those others who might like it.  Where I come from not being a spoiler is just simple respect likely something not everyone can understand.This ranks as the most racially INSULTING vile stupid DVD I have ever seen.  The premise of the story is that black people (Black men in this particular case.) are so lame loathesome and hopelessly dumb that they can not logically be considered worthy of advancing to Harvard or other such IVY League Colleges without the help of "MAGICAL DOPE".  I honestly suspect the only person needing and using MAGICAL DRUGS WAS THE DOPE WHO WROTE THIS DRECK ONLY TO PLACE THIS SPAWN OF HIS PROFOUND NEVER ENDED STUPIDITY ON DVD.I think less of this foolish DVD than I do those old racist movies that portrayed all black people as, "Simple House Boys" bowing and scraping their way through life with the sole goal of "pleasin da masta".  At least older racially debased films lay legitimate claim to being products of a largely ignorant social and intellectual neanderthal nation mired in institutional hate biogotry and oppression.What makes this DVD especially bad is the fact that this is the new face of bigoted negativity in our modern age where some hip hop lackey's gladly take money to create messages that oppress and sell out our own black children.  The suggestion that black people are by nature of birth \ genetics alone inferior is wrapped into the core message of this DVD's storyline.  To watch this DVD youo must buy into its supposition that black people need MAGIC WEED, dope or some other supernatural transcending experience to become the intellectual equals of those who attend ivy league colleges which is the very height of today's more furtive ignorant stupid mindless bigotry disguised as comedy.This DVD functions as a racist tool to rob black men of their dignity, inner strength and self worth by suggesting as truth the lie that we need "MAGIC" to become the equals of those in this society who are afforded opportunities to acheive great things.Tell all the dopes who made this racist DVD you are not buying into their bright new package of old tired racist lies preaching the hate filled Gospel of supposed inheirent black inferiority by leaving this DVD trash on the shelf to rot.  Please do not buy this racist DVD media tool that insults the dignity and intelligence of every black man that has and will ever live.  I pray every black white red yellow whatever your race are stronger and better than sinking low enough to buy this racist filth
0	a fan of the first. this is by far the worst moive I've seen. I LOVE the first secret garden. No one can do a sequel to a moive as good as the origanl. It's a classic. But this sequel is terriable. It controdicts the first moive. It takes the magic away. If you liked the origanl, first moive don't watch this, it will take the magic out of the first moive
0	Movie is TOP - DVD is a FLOP!. This DVD gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 TV screen format of this DVD production is really ridiculous.But the movie is one of my favorites, number 4 on my all time best movies list.The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending. The absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending, by the way, contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer.This movie almost has the quality of a Kubrick
0	Much more bad than good. I ordered this DVD on the basis of some of the reviews - it was a big mistake.  While Terry Dunn is very relaxing to listen to and obviously knows his stuff, the quality of the DVD makes its all but useless as a training tool.  The DVD does not permit selection of the section I want to perform.  The section that introduces you to the basic forms is so washed out that you cannot tell what the foot and hand positions are supposed to be.Finally, in the last segment where Terry performs the complete form, the camera pans in too often so that you cannot actually see the form from start to finish.Sadly, I highly recommend you seek another source of knowledge for this wonderful art.  I know I will be looking for something better.
0	Amazing Reviews!. I am amazed by all the 5 star reviews, how surreal!  No really.  I agree with the 1 star posts. The surreal life on MTV is a bit more, ah surreal.This movie is far from poignant, well...on second thought
0	Not worth the price. I study Amazons in both the ancient world and in modern incarnations of the legends.  You have to watch this movie without expectation of historical anything -- within two minutes I could hear how badly it would destroy anything vaguely historical.  There is a plot and it does circle back to the beginning and reach a conclusion to the opening conflicts but the points between are rather weak.  It has a soft-porn quaity to it -- lots of breasts and female bum, very little male nudity, the sex is all distant and softly lit.  Ultimately it feels like someone had an interesting idea, some productors messed with it and got their sex buddies jobs in it, and the result is something not really worth you dollars
0	Poor Casting, Predictable Story. Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes.  Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending.  There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl
0	A Little Disappointing. 'Fat Girl' is a daring and explicit film that tries to explore the confusion, anxiety, violence of teenage sexuality.  It stars two sisters who are trying to find their sexual identity.  One of the sisters is a stunning beauty, while the other is a pudgy outcast.  They are on vacation, and the beautiful one meets a handsome college student who steals the virginity from her.  What saves the film from being a complete waste and being absolutely pointless is the dialogue between the characters.  The dialogue is fantastic as they show the bitterness and cynicism of two sexually confused teenagers.  It shows the emotional abuse that teenagers put on each other.The ending of 'Fat Girl' seems to have become very famous by now.  Yes, it is absolutely shocking, but the ending does not bring any sense or hope to the overall film.  It is an extremely pessimistic look humanity, and also, might I say, a savagely sexist outlook on males.  I don't know what the director is trying to say; maybe she is just trying to just shock the audience as much as she can, but many people will leave the movie thinking they have wasted their time.
0	Carp almost gets it back, yet loses it again. Pro-Life, a near hour-film for the Masters of Horror series on Showtime, is about a siege by three anti-abortionist boys and their father on an abortion clinic to "rescue" their sister who is impregnated by a demon. The first thing that pops into ones mind when the credits role is a lame phrase for a bad film: " Oh, where art thou talent gone, Mr. Carpenter." In Pro-Life this master is about half-way to his glory days for about forty-five minutes, or so. It might be an imperfect first two-thirds, but its still the best stuff he has done in a while. Yet, then it seems like he just went and ran out of money, because the editing becomes so irritating due to its choppiness, that this awkwardness seems like Carpenter just tries to get the film over and forgets something called "buildup:" as the flow in this last block just does not seem clean.  The film starts out good enough with a pissed of Ron Pearlman of Hellboy fame getting in shootouts with the doctor of the clinic. This is a good action scene, if done somewhat pedestrian, but its still all in fun, not to be taken seriously. While shades of  Carpenter`s latter-day, "Assault on Precinct 13" come to mind in the good way, and there's some great `n gross f/x scenes. Yet, the dialogue in the entire film is pretty awful, and the script does not seem to make many good statements on this controversial subject, besides being the backdrop of the story. Yet, this is not where it fails, it falters in the  concluding scenes in which the demon is featured, and this aspect to the story is simply not needed in a plot that should have just concentrated on human horror, and took its time, without rushing to the end credits.* 1/2 (Out of 5
0	I have autism and this movie is so UNREAL IT STINKS!. If you are a die hard Bruce Willis fan this movie is for you.  Bruce never fails at being himself a great action hero character and here Bruce does not disappoint.  The problem with this movie is the movie itself.  It is so untruthful as to be lame.  I have autism.  I am diagnosed with high functioning autism now but that was not always the case.  In my childhood I was more towards the catatonic side of the autism spectrum.The kid was so one demensional and flat.  While some autistic people can see patterns really well the little things the quirky natures and odd mannerisms absent or were wrong.  Being autistic is like living in a seperate world all your own while simulteanously trying to understand and survive in this world.  When you are autistic there is always a tug of war between the two opposing worlds that manifests itself somehow in the persons "acting out".  Especially at the extreme youth of the so called autistic child it is hard to beleive he was that in control of his senses and responses to humans.  When I was eight years old as a high functioning autistic I have no where near that level of self control in changing stimulus soak environments full of people.It is a ok movie get it if you want.  I guess its why real police officers never watch most cop drama's because they see live and experence police work real life and what they see on film seldom matches their reality.  Likewise Murcury rising is a great film to awaken neurotypicals to the existance of autistic people but please know it is stereotypical, superficial and trite in its handling of autism.  There is both more vigor and hope in life on the the autistm spectrum than this movie reveals.  This Murcury Rising despite its major flaws is an excellent first step on your journey to understand autism because it shows you care.  Rain Man is a better movie dispite some of its relatively minor flaws.I saw the movie Murcury Rising and it was so bad I did not want it in my collection because to me it just did not feel real or meaningful to me in any way.  Of course my tastes do not run in tandem with normal human tastes so most neurotypicals will likely love Murcury Rising but I am hard pressed to give it even one star
0	Definitive portrayal of generation X (for what that's worth). Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays.Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.
0	NO STARS movie!. A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade. The all important role of Shiela seems little more than an after thought. Turned into a silly love story (which doesn't even play!) it is merely sad. Sad...and very, very BAD!!!(the one star rating is because I HAD to rate it!
0	Not worth seeing. George Segal is a good actor, but he is out of his element in this type of movie.  He is much better in light-hearted movies like "Fun With Dick and Jane."The biggest disappointment is the dialog by Harold Pinter.  The characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens, and we all get bored.This spy movie is not even in the same league with "Day of the Jackel" and "The Odessa File."I threw away my copy of "The Quiller Memorandum" after watching it once.  I can't imagine ever wanting to see it again
0	Rent if you want to see, not a collectors item. These plays were okay, I'm glad I rented them before buying them.  The props and things were very nice, the actors didn't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre ( definitely no Tyler Perry quality on that note) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out.  I thought Alexander O'Neal sang in one of them but he didn't
0	It killed an evening that needed to die, anyway. Thank God I borrowed this one from the library! Every time I saw a spinning propeller I thought of what my WWII veteran parents must be doing in their shared grave if they saw any of this crap through my eyes. I couldn't even enjoy the battle scenes because of the technical anomalies and anachronisms. It did keep me watching for the entire three hours just hoping it might get better and it finally did when it stopped
0	I love most of Bob Odenkirk's work... I think I've seen almost everything Bob's been involved with and this just didn't do it for me. If you have friends and they aren't complete dullards, you've probably had most of the conversations you'll see in this movie
0	Meh. The meta-story of this film was potentially interesting, but only before the gathering of the bad actors of the roundtable.One star each for Cross and Black, whose genuine talent are the only reasons to bother glancing at this movie. Unless you are the type to grow an emotional bond with unlikeable characters, whose masturbatory storytelling is untinteresting and unbelievable, I would recommend you spend ninety minutes of your life doing anything other than watching Melvin Goes to Dinner
0	Lies!. It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie
0	BUY SOMETHING ELSE!. This movie was a major disappointment.  The plot is awful.  The dialogue stinks.  The camera-work is amateurish, even by b-movie sleaze standards.  It's poorly lit.  The acting is terrible, and most of the actresses are in fact ugly slags.  There is a lot of nudity, but don't expect to be aroused by it.  The people who made this did not put much effort into it at all and it shows.  I guess they figured that nudity + perversion was a big enough selling point, and that they could lazily toss the rest of the movie together in a slapdash manner.  Unfortunately, this movie does not even excel on the nudity and perversion front, except for perhaps the odd fellow who has a thing for trannies.  In other words, this movie has no redeeming value, and even the onanist should look elsewhere.  For something in a similar vein and from the same era, but that is actually enjoyable, I'd recommend something from the Something Weird catalogue instead.
0	I like Lenny Bruce just fine, but... I always thought of Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie, which I haven't seen, and the movie producer from WAG THE DOG, which I love. Or RAIN MAN, another fine film. But hey, the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it. Hoffman became Lenny Bruce. Bruce's material was great at times and awful at others. Nowadays, of course, none of it would be shocking. The film shows us Bruce's faults, unedited, presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses. But still, something is missing. Something crucial. I don't know what. I only know this film could have been so much better.
0	not worth the time!!!!. this movie is such a bore that i sold it 2 hours after i watched it. not even lori singer was able to help this sad and unscary movie. a waste of time and money

0	did they read the book??. while not one of his best novels, tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time! jimmy smits does his best,but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble!! SKIP IT!!!!
0	It works, if you like formulaic garbage. "On Demand", the service offered by many cable and satellite providers, is proving its worth. It's getting me to watch movies I would never have watched before.This is one of those films that every starving altruistic screenwriter wishes he could write, but wouldn't dare because he values art above all else - even money. I would imagine that the writer was handed the plot by someone at Columbia, saying, "We need an action film involving a Chinese mob, a renegade hit man, a pretty girl, and a `hit' that makes the hit man go straight".How much more formulaic can you get?It sticks to the formula, for better or worse. Assassin encounters moral conundrum and can't kill target. Mob orders hit on assassin. Assassin goes to beautiful girl for help. Beautiful girl helps him in shoot-outs that she couldn't possibly have survived in a real-life scenario. Yada-yada. You can guess the rest. There's no question who will be the victor, and who will be spoiled.The saddest part was that Mira Sorvino's tremendous talents are - once again - wasted.Speaking of wasted, I won't waste more words. In addition, don't waste your time on this. I'm glad that I didn't pay for it.I am utterly astonished that ANY reviewer gave this five stars, or that it inspired another reviewer to write, "Gun Fu ballet at its finest". What the "H"? As I said, this is nothing more than a formulaic film made to - it hopes - appeal to those who enjoy movies about the Chinese mob. When you look at the films gross receipts, and its budget, you be the judge - it failed. It cost $30m to make, and grossed $35m worldwide. That's considered a monumental failure.
0	Average Jackie Film at Best. I say this because Jackie doesn't usually do wired Kung-Fu and this movie utilized that. It also utilized the sped up frame rate to make the fighters appear more skilled. Now that being said, the martial artists really are quite skilled. They really are pretty quick. They really can do most of those moves. It had some OK though special effects assisted fights, but this movie wasn't really about that. Jackie Chan was trying to break into "real" acting in this movie. I wouldn't buy it if you are trying to watch him fight, and if you buy it for the story....well that's your choice I guess
0	Disappointed. I would love to review this Lions Gate DVD, but I can't catch one word in ten.  It is NOT, as advertised, closed-captioned, and the characters' speech is too casual and British for me to get.  Drat! -- I was so chuffed to see there was a cc version
0	To basic. i bought this ballet 101 and 201. it is very ,very basic. i learned most of this stuff in 2 classes. i am glad i didnt buy this from here because it is almost 22 dollars. i bought the VHS versions somewhere else and only paid 11 dollars.. which after today i still think is to much. this still a good video but not enough time is spent on warm-up which could lead to hurting yourself if you dont know what you are doing. i say warn up for about 20 mins before doing any ballet. do not let your kids do this alone they will hurt themselves. it is great for in between classes to stay current and develop technique but you and you child will pass up this dvd/vhs in a few classes and find no need for it very soon. i suggest the The ballet workout it is an older taper but much more indepth about the barre work and center work and alot harder, and actually more fun
0	This is not what it seems. One reviewer wrote the review about the "Super Ants"....this is not that movie.This movie staring Dean Cain bites big time, unless you like movies about chases....there are several car chases, car chasing man, man chasing man, helicopter chasing car....Get the point?The plot is strained through out the movie in dribbles... if you can make it through the endless sceens showing actors walking around doing nothing,walking or staring blankly (probably wondering if this movie will ever be over).*** Fast forward special**
0	Think James Bond mixed in with a little Hentai. I really had big expectations going into this series.  Reading the other reviews on here I thought that I was in for something fanstastic, but my expectations were not met.Crying Freeman starts off with a lot of promise.  There's a mysterious charachter, a love connection, and then a destiny met-- all things that give the series a strong foundation.  After the initial introduction to the story and main charachters, the series falls apart.  Enter killing after killing, mission after mission that seem to lead to absolutely nowhere, sensless nudity, and you get an absolutely rediculous and humerous plot.Before I watched this series, one thing that a reviewer said stuck into my mind "the charachters seem to drop their clothes for no reason." Boy was he right.  The amount of nudity in this series gets so over the top that you have to wonder why it was put in.  Weere the producers looking for a crime-drama or were they looking for a hentai(anime porn)?  The amount of times that the charachters just casually take their clothes off makes one wonder.The sketching?  hmmm, Crying Freeman is an early 90's anime so you can't expect it to have the level of excellence of today, but some of the charachter sketches are very amatueristic.  There is one scene in particular that will make you laugh.. It's a certain decapitation scene in the latter part of this movie--look out for how the blood spurts lol.All in all, Crying Freeman has too many flaws.  There is no build up of the charachter Freeman.  In the beginning of the movie, he talks about leaving Japan and moving on with his wife, yet, as the story progresses he remains a brute killer.  Also, where exactly does his story lead to?  The only thing that occurs in this movie is a bunch of run ins with rivals and a bunch of deaths.  Where is the progression of the charachters and their lives?  There's none.  Despite it's shortcommings, Crying Freeman is a VERY entertaining anime.  The death scenes are artsy and flashy, and the women (yes, I actually got turned on by these anime women--hard to believe) and sex scenes that they're involved in are pretty steamy.I'd say to give this one a shot.  Don't go in expecting some Godfather bit, though.  Just approach it with an open mind and heart
0	Nice Cinematography, Shame About The Script. The film looks good. That cannot be denied. It looks stylish and is directed with flair. Unfortunately, the script plays out like it's the product of an immature adolecent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age. The dialogue is just cringeworthy.One cannot help but think that someone indulged Tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project - indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it - and made a big boob on all counts.I scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its (much trumpeted) blood and guts didn't produce a single goosebump. It was like watching a cartoon.Disappointing.
0	WELL INTENTIONED, PERHAPS -- BUT SIGNIFICANTLY FLAWED. There are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character, Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the 'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance, hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the hands of the Nazis.I'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations, and then get into my main problem with the film.  The production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-TV movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture. The image quality on the DVD could have been much better as well.  Also, the Shanachie DVD release is version of the film that has been dubbed with English.  This is, in the case of this film, not very well-done.  The cabaret singer, for instance, comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn't match her face or ethnicity in the least.  Everyone in the film winds up with an English accent, which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing.Another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children, Stella (portrayed by Linda Jablonska).  Her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl. She develops a bit of a crush on Antoine, which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show, with her as one of the leads, who is kind and supportive and friendly to her, who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect.The problem I had was with one scene in particular.  Stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police.  She bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence.  In the process of getting away, she gets muddy, scrapes herself bloody in a few places, and tears her clothing.  She goes to Moreau's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window.  When he opens it, he is shocked at her condition, lets her into the room, and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes, asking what had happened.  He then draws a bath for her, so she can wash herself.  As Moreau sits down, still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her, she steps into the bath.  Just before she pulls her dress over her head, she says to him, `No looking.'  He shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `Of course', then repairs to the adjoining bedroom, where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke, allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy.  A moment later, he hears a noise and looks up to see Stella emerge from the bathroom, completely naked, in a full-frontal nude shot.  Moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers, suggesting that she warm herself.  She climbs into the bed; he covers her up, and steps away to the other side of the room.  There is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred.  He has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy.This shot only lasts a few seconds, but I feel that, regardless of the director's reasoning for shooting it in the first place, it could have been left out.  If the point was to show that Moreau has either had morals all along, or that he has acquired them, it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways.Earlier in the film, Stella had witnessed one of her caregivers, semi-nude, in Moreau's hotel room (Stella saw this from outside).  Given her `schoolgirl crush' on Moreau, it seemed natural for her to become upset over this.  As a result, however, the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour.  This, combined with the `adult' voice dubbed over Stella's, makes the scene even more disquieting.There are some viewers who might argue that, in Europe, `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the US.  In many instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with them.  There is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of American culture and moral values, and not a little bit of neurosis.  However, the sexual objectification of children is something about which I feel very strongly...and I think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not so prudish that I turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film, if it's not gratuitous and it's an integral part of the storyline...but here, it involves a prepubescent girl, and could have easily been left out.  It worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers.  Have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can't recognize an instance where it's not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful?I'm glad I've seen the film -- and I'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations, as noted above. With all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the Holocaust never happened, I think it's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen.The Czech film ALL MY LOVED ONES is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out.n.b. -- This is the second time I have posted this exact review.  I noticed today (6 April 2006) that it has, for some reason, been removed from the site.  I've re-read what I've written, and I don't see anything objectionable or offensive.  The issues I have with the film are discussed straightforwardly.  If anyone objects to anything I've written here, I'd like to know what it is.

0	Who wrote this?. Waste of time.  I turned it off.  The "extra features" were slightly interesting.  The actual film was just a vehicle for the creators to show themselves dancing.  A vanity piece.  Why not present just the dance and save us from excruciating, badly-written melodrama.  Don't bother

Another bunch of losers, who believe that just to show the artist in action is not what music lovers are after, were allowed to screw up ones again. Don't buy this one hour long McDonalds commercial with "Traffic" music as a soundtrack
0	A Charming And Quirky Romantic Comedy--"Apartment 12" Delivers Everything Except Charm, Romance And Comedy. I have always admired Mark Ruffalo's indie sensibilities.  He has had some high profile and mainstream roles, but to me he'll always be an indie actor--a person to whom art is more important than commerce.  But let's face it, you're not always going to hit it out of the park--not every project enhances your resume.  Let's chalk "Apartment 12" up to a wrong headed misfire.Nothing about this tedious film works.  It's one of those "quirky" ensemble pieces where everyone is larger than life.  These films can be delightful or disastrous--my inclination on "Apartment 12" should already be clear.  In the wacky apartment complex Ruffalo finds himself in, there are the requisite oddballs.  The situation rings as false as a bad sitcom with everyone leaving their doors open for the sole purpose of letting mayhem ensue.But the film also wants to be a romantic comedy.  Problem is--Ruffalo's character is such an unappealing guy, it's hard to imagine anyone thinking he was a catch.  As a failed artist and pizza delivery boy, Ruffalo is childish, slovenly and superior--basically a loser in every regard.  "I'm a painter, I should be dating models from Milan."  That's about as much insight as the film has into his artistic integrity.  His romantic partner in this escapade, of course, is too good to be true.  But to show you the apparent lack of interest this film actually has in it's characters--we never know what she does for a living.  It's something vaguely professional in a building with lawyers--that's all you really need to know.Add to the wacky ensemble and forced romance--we have a self indulgent, empty headed look at the art community.  Cliche'd in every way possible, much that occurs in this milieu is cringe-worthy.  In typical Ruffalo fashion, at a showing he tells the artist his work is "unoriginal, banal and contrived."  Hmmm--sounds like some films I know, too.  KGHarris, 11/06
0	Save your time and money. This is another of the endless type of Hollywood movie that is lame, puerile, and stupid. I won't go into detail with examples of the lame attempts at humor, since other reviews here cover that well. And sure, as the the cover suggests, it's got a bunch of sexy babes in it, but don't watch it for them either, because there's very little to see of them. The only decent sexy scene is a hot tub one with several topless girls that runs maybe 2 minutes. Further, the cover advertises "4 UNRATED deleted scenes" as though those are sexy scenes, but they're NOT at all. So, if you're looking for very corny, adolescent humor, this film may be for you, but otherwise avoid it like the plague
0	Someone please rip my eyes out... What if I had made a horror movie in high school? It would have gone something like this..My best friend Tara, an aspiring thespian who can fake cry really well, would be my star.  Before filming, we'd make sure to touch up Tara's delicious golden locks.  Oooops, A little bit too much bleach!My story would revolve around a group of teenagers trapped in a strange house where they'd stumble upon an eerie, comatatose man wearing a bathing suit (Tom from the swim team would be a perfect fit...of course we'd have to shave his head...I wonder if he'd be willing?). The strange house will be dark and water will be dripping from everywhere, maybe in slow motion.  Tara and my other friends/actors will be extremely dim witted, and mostly deaf so that they can't hear each other very well.  My characters will then die one by one in entirely standard an unoriginal death sequences.  I'll think of some totally absurd story to tie everything together later, but it is sure to be absolutely terrifying. I'll save money by using a lot of stock footage, staging the car accident just "after" the accident occurs, and  scoring the music myself on my Casio at home.   Genius.  I'm going to be the most popular guy in school
0	Lust in aisle seven. If Jennifer Aniston's "Friend" Rachel Greene ever had a weird dream I could imagine it to be just like this minimum-waged, sex- changed variation of "The Graduate."  But just like Rachel, I'd probably shake it off as a weird time spent in the twilight zone."The Good Girl" would have believe that somewhere in Red State U.S.A. Aniston is a frustrated 30 year old sales clerk in a mythical "K-Martesque" store called the "Retail Rodeo." Her name, pun intended, Justine Last. As we can deduce from Aniston's off screen monologue (which she reads in a Forest Gump-ish, "Id-like-to-be-profound, but-I-just=got hit-by-a=baseball-bat" kid of sound), she feels trapped just like all the seemingly robots around her.  Married to a pot-headed, dim bulb of a husband (the wonderful John C. Reilly), Last yearns to be rescued and believes she's finds her shining knight in the person of an introverted but passionate younger man named Holden Worther(Jake Gyllenhaal).  The sex is great, of course, and before Last can bask in her newfound sense of intimatacy and hope for a better life she must contend with a major problem- Holden is a lovesick loon.From there on director Miguel Arteta and writer Mike White turn the tables on our own expectations for finding love in odd places .  No last minute romantic rescues here for "The Good Girl" is ultimately a cynical, extramarital version of "A Simple Plan" where one misdeed leads serio-comically to another.It's game for part of the way but the movie ultimately is phoney.  Another condescinding, Hollywood take on life in fly-over land as a fate worse than death.  All the characters are made to go a beat slower and drag around their surroundings like zombies from the movie "Dawn of the Dead." Further proof of the filmakers blue state status are depicted by haveing Gyllenhaal's parents act   like the subjects in the painting "American Gothic." They're two  silent, moronic centurians.Aniston is just too sitcom spunky and creamy-complexted for the low-rent heroine.  Her homestyle accent comes and goes while Gyllenhaal's hair looks as if it was styled somewhere on Rodeo Drive. The movie's one bright spot is Zooey Deschanel as Aniston's morose co-worker.  A funny riff she repeated in the movie "Failure To Launch."  Wake up, Rachel.  Wake up
0	Poor Release of Movie. I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin

0	Depends on what you want. If you want to see Mr. Milan demonstrate his personal rapport with animals, this DVD will fill the bill.  However, if you are seeking advice and instruction on how to overcome aggression in your pet, this DVD will not be of much help.  The DVD is really nothing but an infommercial praising Mr. Milan's talents. I seriously doubt that the dogs he works with in the DVD maintain their non-aggressive behavior after he leaves. The strategies he uses, such as having the aggressive dog walk beside his non-aggressive pack dog, are not practical for the average dog owner. If someone were going to hire Mr. Milan as a personal dog trainer, this item would certainly serve as a recommendation, but it is woefully lacking as step-by-step instruction on how to overcome aggression in a dog
0	URBAN CRAP. 99 mins of suck..good thing i don't have a life..some nudity (eva mendes' fun bags?) definitely would have raised this movie another star..couldn't wait to look at the talent files(he he)after the movie was over..can't wait for the next one
0	Good special effects, trite story line, mediochre acting. I haven't seen a Superman movie since the first Christopher Reeve flic back in the 80s, so I'm probably behind the times on these.  Just picked this one up on a whim and, though it had its entertaining moments, it was overall rather mundane.The special effects were very cool, but they were forced to carry the weight of a lightweight script.  How many times can we see Superman, Lois and family, and "the average Joes" be in seemingly fatal circumstances only to be rescued at the last second by either the Man of Steel himself, or (in the case of Superman) by Lois?  After a while the pattern gets tedious.Also, fear I have some quibbles about the acting.  The good guys were merely okay (all of them could have done a lot more to make their characters more fun and memorable), but the bad guys were downright BORING.  Parker Posey seemed like she was asleep while she delivered her lines as Lex Luthor's girlfriend; Kevin Spacey seemed to be trying a little harder to bring Luthor to life, but, alas, he pretty much failed.Whole cast and crew seemed like they were under the influence of ultrapowerful Kryptonite that kept them weak and sleepy. Too bad
0	Blade Trilogy Ending Deserves Better Than This !!. This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort.
0	Soundtrack intolerable. I found the singing in the soundtrack so utterly intolerable that I had to quit watching this after about 20% of the video. The movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise (about a 4). The sound of the singing was very grating & harsh to my ears; since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible. It also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content. The photography & art direction were exquisite
0	A two hour music video for "Que Sera Sera". I haven't seen the original "Man", so I can only judge this movie on its own merits and how it generally compares to other movies by the same director.  It's not good Hitchcock, and this is why:* The characters were all forgettable, save for the assassin, who got about a 9.5 on the creep scale.  Doris Day's character was useless, save for her singing ability, and yes, amazingly, the only time she did anything to help was during the climactic scene, when she screamed.  Jimmy Stewart's character was pretty good, but only when he was working alone - the puss factor went up considerably when he teamed up with wifey.  I was hoping from the start of the film, and even more so after the early parent/child duet scene, that the son hadn't even existed in the first place.  Bernard could have shaped up to be a decent character, but he got whacked REAL early... too bad...* The story and direction sucked.  Hitchcock could have used the central couple's inability to speak French as a means of isolating them and increasing the paranoia (similar to what Carol Reed did in "The Third Man"), but he didn't, which made the early setting in Morocco unnecessary.  Stewart and Day were supposed to be in desperate search of their kidnapped son, but accomplished their investigation so slowly, it was intensely annoying (TEDIUM DOES NOT EQUAL SUSPENSE).  There were almost no good twists to speak of, and about fifteen minutes after Bernard's death in the beginning, the sense of urgency was lost.  The couple made absolutely no plan to get their son back.  In fact, they ended up confronting the kidnappers directly - such a stupid (and boring) move - and still everything just kind of turned out okay in the end - damn, I almost pulled my hair out.  Guns were introduced so late in the film - and all that time before, Jimmy could have just run upstairs, grabbed his son and ran out with him.  And when Stewart's character pushed the gunman down the stairs, I was thinking, dude, that works for Bogey, but not for you.* There were few Hitchcock moments. The orchestra scene ended really stupidly with Day's scream (one person screams and all of a sudden the killer can't shoot straight - WHAT?!), but people seem to think that that scene's tense. Dude, it's not - you're watching the wrong Hitchcock flick, I'm sorry.  The only good parts of that scene were the shot of the cymbals resting on the chairs, and the one shot of the assassin looking down the barrel of his Luger - the rest was pure filler.* Besides "Que Sera Sera", which is only a decent song anyways, the music was stock.  Can't remember any of it.  No memorable scene-stealing sound effects, either.Apparently, Hitchcock thought this was the better version.  He was either stoned out of his mind when he said that, or the original was total crap.This movie does not deserve four-and-a-half stars, especially being that it's an average score taken from (currently) 65 reviews.  What the hell, people?  I only borrowed this from the library and still felt cheated after I saw it.  Four-and-a-half stars?!  There is absolutely no way this is on par with "Vertigo".Sorry, this review is fairly antagonistic, and meaningless in many areas for people who haven't yet seen the film, but hopefully people who read this will understand what I'm getting at and will not make the mistake of buying the movie just because it's another "acclaimed masterpiece".ALFRED HITCHCOCK MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEEN A GENIUS, BUT THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM.  DO NOT BUY ON IMPULSE UNLESS YOU ARE A HITCHCOCK FANATIC
0	A has-been. The reviewers here are rating the performer, not the show. Stritch looks haggard, sings horribly, and most of her stories are only interesting to her. A dreadful performance all around
0	Not as bad as its reputation. "A Night in Heaven" opened in 1983 to terrible reviews and even worse box office.  It was a mainstay on ten worst lists everywhere.  It was dubbed "Flashdunce" after another hit movie of that year.Really, its not that bad.  Insubstantial, yes.  Ill-conceived, yes.  Entertaining?  Quite.Lesley Anne Warren plays Faye, a speech professor at the local community college who is having marital problems.  Her husband Whitney (Robert Logan), an emotionally stunted inventor, has seemingly lost interest in her and she is becoming depressed when her sister Patsy (Deborah Rush) takes her out with friends to a local strip club.  There, Faye is surprised that the club's star stripper, Ricky the Rocket (Christopher Atkins), is the same cocky student she just flunked in her class.  When he sees her in the audience, Ricky does a virtual lapdance for her, and it isn't long before they have plunged into an affair.Actually, there was probably a very good, serious film buried somewhere in writer Joan Tewkesbury's original script, which is glossily directed by Oscar-winner John G. Avildsen, who went from this fiasco to "The Karate Kid".  Unfortunately, the casting of Christopher Atkins in what was obviously originally a supporting role hurts the film considerably.  Cast after his breakthrough role in "The Blue Lagoon", Atkins received star billing and all of the film's pre-release publicity.  But Warren and Logan are the lead characters, have most of the screen time and obviously have the main relationship in the film.  This caused the film to be quite obviously heavily reedited to emphasize the Atkins character, who is a total jerk, completely amoral and unlikable, and poorly played by one of the worst actors ever to be spit out of the Hollywood system.  This sinks the film faster than the "Titanic".  As a result, what should have been a serious examination of a marriage at a crossroads becomes a smarmy sex-comedy/marital drama in which the disparate elements just don't fit.  Note the brief 80 minute running time.  This is one film which I wish could be reedited to a director's cut, so we can see what the writer and director's original intent was.  Instead, we will forever be saddled with the studio's botched reedit.In spite of all this, "A Night in Heaven" remains entertaining and easy to watch.  Lesley Ann Warren gives a good performance here, although I'm sure this film isn't listed on her otherwise stellar resume.  Robert Logan is also quite good, although his presence is a bit of an eye-opener considering he is best-known for family films like "The Wilderness Family" and this film comes as close to soft-core porn as any major Hollywood studio film of recent decades.  Deborah Rush gives able support, and there's a decent performance here by an actress named Sandra Beall as Ricky's long-suffering girlfriend Slick.  The late Carrie Snodgress also has a couple of good scenes as Ricky's mother.  Unfortunately, Atkins' horrible acting just about negates the performances of everyone around him.  It's impossible to do excellent work when the person you are acting with can't act to save his life.  It makes you appreciate Warren's work even more.  That she manages to give a good performance under the circumstances is commendable.One note:  This film contains one of the sexiest love scenes I have ever seen in a film, and is one of only three reasons to see it.  The other two?  Warren's performance and Bryan Adams' now-classic love them "Heaven", which plays in its entirety over the opening and closing credits.  When you take away the seven minutes for these sequences, that leaves 73 minutes of story, which makes the cuts even more noticeable."A Night in Heaven" is one bomb from the early '80's that should have been much better, but remains more entertaining than many much better films of the era.**1/2 (out of *****);  ** for execution; *** for entertainment value
0	Logo Imprint Compromises Presentation. I was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories.  I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film).  Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series.Much to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs.  What's that all about?  Does MLB Productions think I'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills?  Thank goodness I don't own a plasma TV or I'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years!Sound and picture quality are okay otherwise.  But....that logo is really annoying
0	I don't know how to explain this much suck.... This is just pathetic...Uwe Boll makes a better zombie film...really...They need to let this franchise die or find Russo & let him save it...But, it's probably too late - the cancer that is parts 4 & 5 has spread...This makes part 3 look like high art...I love zombie films more than any kind of horror..I own more than most people know exist...I don't say this to soud like a know it all but this movie is just embarrasing...You can cover dog poo in powdered sugar & call it candy, but this movie coated dog poo with more dog poo & called it candy..
0	The dreams of youth are the regrets of maturity. In school you are sometimes asked to summarize extremely lengthy books into one or two sentences to evaluate your knowledge on that certain piece of literature.  To me, that always seemed ridiculous because how could you accurately depict the true value of a 300-page book within two measly paragraphs?  That feeling is exactly my reaction to Ridley Scott's overly produced and underly executed film, Legend.  Throughout the film I felt that Scott had the potential to go anywhere and everywhere, really making this underground cult fantasy film bigger than The Neverending Story and Lord of the Rings put together.  I felt this way because 80s fantasy films seemed to be less commercial and more imaginative than those released in the past decade.  I was waiting for a stronger outing of Willow, but instead I saw Legend disintegrate right before my eyes.  It was as if Ridley had 300-plus pages of material, but had to condense it all into two very small paragraphs.  What ultimately happened was that we, the viewer, were cheated out of quite a bit of potential visuals, creative lands, and mythical creatures.  We were instead handed a body of work that seemed to grasp at straws instead of development, weak heroic characters with an exaggeration on Curry's over-the-top "Price of Darkness" portrayal, and a finale that teetered on sarcasm instead of excitement.Legend, in my eyes, begins with an unsettling "bang".  We see no characters outside of a menacing voice that speaks in rhyme and talks about the end of light.  Scott pulls us gracefully in by giving us these highly imaginative characters and a world that we think will be full of Hensen-esque creatures.  Alas, immediately after pulling at our dark sides, he slaps us in the face with what seems like an hour of pointless drivel with conversation between the Princess Lilly and her man-boy Jack (played by Mia Sara and Tom Cruise respectively).  Caught between horrid writing, unfamiliar past experiences, and a uni-brow the size of Kansas on Cruise's face, we are left with nothing to do except wait.  With the promise of unicorns and a possible dark future, we wait.  The unicorns finally appear and darkness does become momentarily triumphant, but what never brings us back to that immediate opening of dark delight is that Scott never recreates it for us.  Legend fails, not just because of the shallow acting, but because the story never quite hits the momentum it had at the beginning of the film.  While this critic blames Ridley's choice of Sara and Cruise as our guides, I do think he could have strengthened the story to be a bit more energetic and sweeping.  I felt trapped throughout this story, as if the walls that contained Princess Lilly were the actual boundaries of the film.  This hurt Legend.  Unlike other fantasy films of this nature, the walls of a structure may encase our hero, but we know there are bigger and more exotic things happening around the fictional planet.  With Legend, I never felt that.  I felt as if Scott kept us on a lighted path without the comfort or luxury of any outside imagination.  I needed, maybe even wanted, to see more of this planet Scott created, but the door was shut abruptly in my face.I would like to state again that I thought Scott had good intentions with this film, but the final result (either from its original bad screenings to the infamous "director's cut") just didn't feel like it was worth the two hours one had to put into the movie.  Scott had some (I stress "some") moment of excitement, moments of imagination, and moments of sheer fantasy, but they were all clouded by the brazen push of over-the-top melodrama and visions.  What makes most fantasy films work is that you care both for the story as well as the characters.  In Legend, the story seems weak because we care nothing for the characters.  Cruise's portrayal of Jack could have been done by anyone who passed Acting 101, while Curry does give the BEST performance of the film, it is another case of "anyone-itis".  Without the horns or the bold eyes, anyone could have been underneath the mask.  Curry did great, but take him out of the costume and ask the question, does he stand-alone?  Follow this up with some elves and dwarves that seemed more clich than original, and the final result is an ill-fated Legend.  I wanted to like this film.  I knew about the cult-ish status of Scott's fantasy attempt, but in the end, I felt bored instead of moved by the overall picture.Overall, I cannot recommend a second viewing to this film.  I went in expecting a larger-than-life Willow or Neverending Story (or at least enough darkness to counter Alien or Blade Runner), but instead finished the film thinking that in today's standards this would have counted as a "direct to video" release.  Scott, as well as his brother, are fabulous directors and continue to push the boundaries on modern cinema, but Legend failed.  Legend failed because of the story as well as the acting.  Both were not in place, therefore, both could not work together.  During the commentary, Scott mentions his passion for Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but it was obvious that he was just name-dropping to gain film critic's respect.  Legend, if anything, insults Cocteau's masterpiece.  From the wrongly used word of the title (not a legend but a fairy-tale), to Cruise's uni-brow, to the cheaply forgettable ending, Legend didn't impress and it would be very difficult to sit through another viewing without some cash in hand.Grade: ** out of ****
0	Terrible. We struggled through this - luckily we didn't pay to see it. (My stepdaughter owns it, and lent it to me.) A waste of time
0	Unbelievable rubbish pitched at 13 year olds. A number of talented actors walk through this sham, half awake.  Motor cars, and tiny minds, poorly scripted, rubbish for the brain dead.  Get a life.
0	Don't believe the hype. This effort shows it's age. In addition, there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo-scientific method somewhat reminiscent of Mengele. I suppose it's possible for it to be taken as tongue-in-cheek by those at the post-graduate level of study at the Cheech and Chong School of Anthropology. However, I have to admit I was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing
0	GREAT MOVIE!...but... I am writing neither to critique the movie nor to eplore the quality of the video or audio. I would simply like to warn potential buyers of the manufacturer defects that I have enconter with TWO copies of this DVD.The first copy was scratched so severly it looked like a fat guy attempted to use it to ski down slopes of rough pavement. So Amazon promptly shipped out another. The second copy didn't have a scratch but the movie hung up in the EXACT same place as the first. ANNOYING! I am currently waiting on another copy, but if it's bad I'm giving up.*IMPORTANT* Consumers, take my review very seriously because I suspect these other reviewers have no experience with the DVD, they're just fans of the film. And what an awesome film it is
0	The *ahem*...LESSER Farrelly film. Ok, check it out, there's two Jack Blacks. One is the guy from Tenacious D, you see him all the time. He's funny and childish and insane. Then there's the other Jack Black. He's the evil creature who pervades films like Shallow Hal and King Kong, whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident. Well, as long as you aren't fat and don't feel patronized by Gweneth presuming to know what it's like not to be desired all her life (ha), then by all means suspend all disbelief, logic, and brain power and watch this dumb movie. Gweneth's fat suit is actually pretty convincing, although most of the movie she's played by an actual fat chick...who by the way should have just been left in, without the whole "ha ha the dude thinks she's skinny" nonsense. Obviously, a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if:a) He weren't brainwashedb) His fat girlfriend wasn't replaced by a twiggy blond chickc) The movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way (like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it)d) Tony Robbins was in no way involved whatsoeverI knew I was slumming it when I saw this movie.  But I'm not sure what the message of this film is.  Jack Black's character is decent, considerate, great with kids and perfect in every way.  Oh, except he's really shallow for no dicernable reason, other than his dad's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail.  The weird part is that Hal's not a bad person.  The movie beats you over the head showing you he's the nicest guy on on the face of the Earth, so you can't really laugh at him looking like an idiot.  Rosemary is so fat she has superpowers.  Her butt actually creates typhoons (I wonder if that has military applications?).  Suddenly, Hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews.  Tony Robbins brainwashed him, the fiend! When Hal finally realizes this he decides to (ooh big spoiler) love Rosemary anyway, and learns a VALUBLE LESSON.  Along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he's dating Rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss, and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ('cause that would make any woman melt).  Of course there's requisite best friend, played by Jason Alexander, who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get Hal to dump her.  Then again, the friend is a complete troll, so I don't know why Hal would want him around.  And to insult us further, they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a SERIOUS note about how true beauty is on the inside. Too...many...public...service...messages! PICK...ONE..!!But brain-dead writing aside, Paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit (despite Gweneth's postering when this film was first released). Regardless of its clumsy benevolence, I have to rate this as a romantic comedy. And for that, I give it a rating of totally unremarkable. Nice gesture, Farelly brothers. Not to be bothered with
0	You'll Never Get Rich. This is not one of Fred's better efforts,  the dancing is so so and Rita Hayworth is among his poorest dance partners.  Lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the Astaire/Rogers films.  In spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching
0	I wanted to love this . . . This dark mystery wrapped around a school-days farce could have been a really great movie in somebody else's hands, but this director really dropped the ball.  The characters are mostly drawn in such raging generalities that you can pretty much recite the lines before they actors say them.  I wonder if those casting the film have ever met a college student.  They had the varieties right, but the ages were goofy.  The obnoxious film student looked 40, the dream girl model looked more like the hero's big sister than his girlfriend.  The story, on the other hand is interesting in an art-house kind of way but there is so, so much wrong!  Even in the capable hands of Jim Broadbent, the villian of the piece is underdrawn.    Like "A Day Without Mexicans," this was a terrific idea that just didn't wash.  I wish somebody more capable would make it agai
0	Not Good. This is obviously an unauthorised film. A couple of English people with a handycam with nothing new to say
0	Ive seen better ghosts movies then this. This film is just like the The Sixth Sense film.  Both films have the same borring plot.THE BORRING PLOT.In the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them.  After the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers, the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last.The Sixth Sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again.If you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people, you will love 13 Ghosts.  That film is what I called a good ghost film
0	Why waste the cash. This is a poor excuse of a movie. The actors are less than right for these rolls. I will be selling this movie used if anyone wants to waste the cash...
0	It's no warning, it's Predictable!. When I saw the movie, it was so predictable. Halfway into it, the broadcasts were so lame as well as the so-called live-footage. Total rip-off of "War of the Worlds." Reminded meof an NBC-TV movie from the early 80's called, "Special Bulletin." Much better with it's live-broadcasts! The onlything i liked about this movie, when I switched back to catch it's climax ending. They never even saw their ever-ending doom.Sure put's the military in it's place!
0	The Passion of Ayn Rand's Haters. I was skeptical from the beginning about this movie seeing as how it was based on the ridiculous book by Barbara Branden and I must say, all my worst fears were confirmed when I viewed the movie. It could not have been worse than if it was written, produced and directed by someone who detested Rand, but then again it was. The movie portrays Rand as some kind of mind manipulator that preys on the weak and crushes them to be devoured. Rand was the most intelligent thinker of the twentieth century and her ideas challenged two thousand years of religious and cultural beliefs. The individuals involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Rand and the rest of us deserve better than this. This movie is on a level of depravity I can't even describe.
0	Branagh's Frankenstein. Having taught the book for some years and having admired Branagh's talents as well, I was excited to see what he did with the book.  His acting talents are remarkable, again; the sets are exceptional; the liberties taken deplorable.  He ruined it.  Killing Elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable.  The end of Justine is pointless.  Deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster.  Minimal script that truncates and eviscerates. Horribly disappointed, especially by the maudlin sentimental ending...bathos supreme.  Frankly, disgusted.  Kenneth, what are you doing
0	not a good image. based on the novel with the same title by jean de berg. i am sorry: everything is unconvincing, the setting in paris, the actors (except perhaps for claire), the sadomasochistic relationship between the two women and between the two women and the man. this is in part due to the fact that this is an american movie which strictly follows american codes; there is no hint of the real paris and parisians.
0	We all hated this film. I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible.My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end.On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films.Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie
0	Easy Come Easy Go should be for boats fans. If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher. If you are an Elvis Presley fan, then buy or rent Jailhouse Rock on video or dvd
1	To the powers that be at Fox. Just for the record I will be ordering DVD's whenever this is released and sending them to thirty or so of my closest friends which is what I did when The Office (British version) came out and I was a hero. Please!!! We're begging you!
1	A tweedy delight. I first saw this BBC comedy series in its rerun phase on American PBS in the 1980s, and watched my home-recorded VHS tapes over and over again every few months or so. I felt some trepidation getting the DVD set this year, not knowing if the experience would stand up to my memories from so many years past. Now I see that I was silly to worry, for this show is just as fresh and funny as when it first aired in the late seventies. Penelope Keith is devastatingly dead-on as Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton, the unflappable, genteel traditionalist who adjusts her xenophobic upbringing to fall in love and hang on to a piece of her beloved family estate. Peter Bowles is at once dapper, arrogant, bumbling, and sweet as Richard DeVere, the new-money CEO who displaces Audrey from her manor and then proceeds to woo her, and be wooed by her, over the course of 20 charming (and highly addictive) half-hour episodes.The screenwriting is consistently deft and witty, with an ambitious reach that never weighs down the sparkle of its light touch. Audrey and Richard's exchanges remind me of the sophisticated repartees between Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, full of competitive verve and flirty intelligence. Plus, it's just that much more interesting to have your romantic leads battling it out verbally in English riding clothes and Wellingtons. Elsewhere, the show tackles traditional English mores and rituals with both satire and affection. Audrey decries the processed-foods empire that Richard has built and refers to him as "a grocer," only to find that even the village farmers are buying his frozen peas in the local market. Richard climbs to the top of the corporate ladder as a self-made man, only to be frustrated by the prejudices of colleagues who exclude him because he lacks "old school ties." Audrey strides proudly out to her flower garden, secure at being "at one with the seasons of the earth," only to get blown back by a gale-force wind kicked up by the blades of Richard's new helicopter. The country old meets the city new, with hilarious consequences. Will Richard succeed at "reprogramming" the estate farm with a computer? Can Audrey run all of her village errands using a horse-drawn carriage?And let's not forget all the foxhunts, charity balls, birdwatching clubs, and Sunday services that add to the rituals of daily life in this modern pastoral community. There are situations galore to occupy and mystify the unforgettable ensemble cast of supporting characters, who include Audrey's best friend Marjorie, Richard's mother Mrs. Polouvicka (wonderfully portrayed by Daphne Heard, whom some may remember as the forgetful "Nanny" from _Upstairs, Downstairs_), Audrey's long-suffering butler Brabinger, Old Ned the gardener and odd jobs man, Mrs. Patterson the cranky village store owner, the rakish Brigadier, and the sherry-tippling Rector. The acting is realistic and convivial, and the comic timing never fails, making Grantleigh Manor a place you will never tire of going home to.
1	the unsaid is an awesome movie. I brought the DVD because of VINCENT KARTHEISER, he is my favorite movie star. This is a very high quality film. Both Vincent Kartheiser and Andy Garcia performed excellent. I did got a strong feeling for the the scene and air in it, and highly recommend this great indie film.
1	Yet Another Excellent Connery Bond Flick... "You Only Live Twice" has many of the best elements of the entire Bond series; it has the best theme song of them all (which, as pop fans may recognize, was chopped into some super-popular mainstream song a few years back...and proved to be whatever "band"'s one hit for their one-hit wonder music career...anyway, who cares), the best villain (the original Blofeld...that's right...the one that Mike Myers spoofs in "Austin Powers"), and the best looking Asian women of any Bond movie.  This film, for me, ranks third in the series, behind "Goldfinger" and "From Russia With Love"; "Dr. No" is a close fourth (they're all so damn good, how can anyone even compare them?).  The only thing that detracts from this picture is the morphing of Bond into a Japanese man...but that's Roald Dahl for you, folks.  Strange.  However, this film is one of the most entertaining and best of the twenty, and I highly recommend it; it's a blast to watch!  In fact, it remained the best Bond movie made until "GoldenEye" 28 years later, as everything went downhill from here until then (only slightly with Lazenby's effort, then steeply with "Diamonds are Forever" (don't waste your time) into the Roger Moore era).  Bottom line: Buy it now and enjoy
1	Baywatch Is So Cool. I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE AND I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BAYWATCH MOVIES EVER. IT HAS SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AS STARS
1	Soon to be a classic... By now most people have seen this on TV for free several times, so a purchase may be only reserved for the fanatic.  If so, go for it.  A review of this is nearly worthless because Ron's reputation for popularity speaks for itself
1	Wonderful for those who believe Love is possible!. I was typing a review & lost the window, so I hope this isn't a repeat, but I'm starting over on writing this . . .I'm sorry to see the poor reviews by some on this site, whose cynical, jaded views say more about their own attitudes than they do about the film.Among the considerable charms of this independent film are it's personal, somewhat "home-made" qualities, the excellent script & total sincerity of the entire enterprise. It's such a refreshing departure from standard Hollywood fare & from those "independent" films struggling to emulate such formulas. I love the personal touch of ANGORA RANCH, it's considerable humor & eccentricity.Indeed, if you're open to the possibility that Love (yes, CAPPED!) exists, & that special people sometimes find one another among the teeming billions of this planet, you may find this film a treat. In fact, the virtues of this film seem to owe a lot to the director/actor Paul Bright, who also wrote the thoughtful & intelligent script. He's clearly a man of many talents & a film maker to watch.This film is a labor of love & anyone with an open mind & open heart, regardless of your sexual orientation, will find this more than worth your while. In fact, I consider the DVD an excellent investment & suggest you recommend it to others to support & encourage this kind of creativity & the message.What is the message? To me, it affirms the serendipity, the unexpected, quirky ways life may unfold, that Love can happen when you're least expecting it from something as seeminly unrelated as putting on the brakes to avoid running over a bunny. If anyone doesn't get it, that Love is what life is all about, too bad!Though some gay viewers may be drawn to the cute young blond protagonist, for me it was Paul Bright's older character, the "gay son Jackson" that shone & dazzled me. In fact, to me he's an incredibly hot, engaging man. All of the characters have dimension & nuance. This is an alternative gem & & hope it becomes a quiet hit.Especially fine is the performance of Tim Jones as Peter, the father of Jack. ANGORA RANCH will appeal to a range of folks of many kinds who have not given up on Love. The universe is full of possibilities. It IS possibilities! I'm really glad I own this DVD.Bruce P. Grethe
1	Julius Caesar. I am pleased with the DVD.  As a teacher, I strive to present the most up-to-date and high quality materials in my classroom.  I sometimes have difficulty finding classics in this format.  It is excellent.  Thank you
1	Where Is The Second Peak?. Considering the vast amount of TV and film garbage happily making its way out onto DVD, its scandalous that those who currently own the rights to something of the genuine quality of Twin Peaks don't let the public see it. Years have gone by since I purchased this fragment of the original program and yet still no word on the release of the rest of the shows.Whoever the current owners are - show it, or sell it because we want to see it.
1	Pure Entertainment. The Seven Samurai was the basis for that wonderful western The Magnificient Seven, but is in every way a superior movie.  The lighting, the camera angles and acting are all first class.  The director is brilliant.  Enjoy this treasure
1	Private Finnish Film Festival. Young Gods (Hymypoika) shows what happens when four male high school students in urban Finland make a pact to accelerate their personal growth by secretly filming themselves having sex with women and then viewing each others' films.  The four have a variety of outcomes and receive a variety of responses from the women involved.The blond on the DVD cover, Jere (played by Reino Nordin), pushes the idea the hardest and gets goateed, romantic Markus (Jarkko Niemi), and awkward Sami (Ville Kivela) to go along.   Well-off orphan Taavi (Jussi Nikkila) will compulsively film what he can get away with but does not want to be a performer.The women swept up in this are Jere's girlfriend, Reeta (Jenni Banerjee), Markus's girlfriend, Mira (Mervi Takatalo), and Jere's sister, Jenni (Evi Suppala).  Markus discovers an interest in a policewoman, Helena Paakkonen (Laura Malmivaara).The students' plots are found out.  Girlfriends change or drop boyfriends, there are rape attempts, there is a suicide, some women like being filmed, and one student discovers shocking films of his family's past.  To move the action along, there are nude parties, public nude celebrations, standard sex scenes, an S&M anal sex scene, sex with a prostitute, nude conga-lines and more.  Some even have homework.  There is a lot going on.Jere, Markus, Sami, and some extras provide full male nudity. The women do too, though they are more discretely positioned.  Although none of the characters is gay, there are enough bodies and borderline events to keep a gay audience entertained.The photography is remarkably good.  The actors are convincing.The extras are trailers, TV spot ad, music video, and English subtitles for the Finnish.Some ideas are so bad that seeing is believing
1	4.5; delightfully original. I have a theory: audiences are getting smarter. Whereas before a big Hollywood movie with a massive marketing push would've been all the rage, now people are starting to know better. They're realizing that a terrible movie's a terrible movie no matter how often we can see Julia Roberts deal with more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff Michael Bay can destroy. So when a movie comes along like Being John Malkovich, or Memento or even visually impressive like the Matrix, we stand up and take notice. Building a career largely from inventive music videos, first time director Spike Jonze comes out of the gate with probably the most unconventional comedy you'll see.Loserly Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, always good) is an aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work. Then he has his dishevelled looking wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) leaving in their small New York apartment with pets everywhere since Lotte's a pet store worker. Craig, due to his puppeteering skills gets accepted at a company located, amusingly, on the 7 1/2 floor, complete with cramped ceilings. He also has a strong attraction to one of his co-workers, feisty Maxine (Catherine Keener). One day while working, he discovers a small day and going inside he finds out he can see the world through John Malkovich's eyes for 15 minutes with an unceromonious dump on the New Jersey turnpike ditch.Craig and Maxine get an idea: charge 200$ for people to experience being John Malkovich which is a novel idea until Lotte goes through and feels a deeper connection, especially around the idea of Maxine. Then we have a bizarre love square or star or something since Craig loves Maxine who loves Lotte but only when Lotte is inside John Malkovich...'s head. Try not to wrap your head around it since it's better explained in the movie and after awhile you don't even worry about stuff like vessels or portals, you just go with it.Casting is of course important and no one seems wasted, even Diaz, who I normally can't stand. The real treat though is of course Malkovich since at times you almost can't tell if he's acting or if he's really that quirky. Then there's the comedy which is subtle to the first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like the 7 1/2 floor and the small ceilings but then the film shows you what happens when Malkovich steps through his own portal and it becomes not only a technical marvel but one of the flat-out funniest things I've seen lately. Only problem with the story is that at a certain point it shifts gears and the film almost speed walks to its climax rather than lurching forward, like it was shot in the foot.Like the Amazon review says, I don't know if the film can warrant repeat viewings and you can get more out of it every time you see it but that first viewing is quite something
1	Camille Caudel. Perhaps the only sculpture movie I ever saw. Very French. She finally looses her mind at the end. Much angst
1	Tame and often sweet compared to later seasons. Viewing the first season of Melrose Place, one would be hard-pressed to peg this as the over-the-top sudsy sleazefest it would become.  Conceived as a spin-off to the popular "Beverly Hills 90210," "Melrose Place" was aimed at the burgeoning Gen X demographic that was the darling of producers in the years post-Reagan/Bush.The cast is young and pretty, and servicably talented.  The characters they created are a little green around the edges in this first season, but there's substance in the proceedings, as a group of strangers forges a faux family out of socio-economic instability, flirty chemistry, and a genuine affection for their shared abode - an eden of greenery, wrought iron balconies and the ubiquitous pool in the courtyard.  Frankly, such a place would have been way out of the price-range for a pack of 20-somethings that includes a struggling actress, a social-worker, a construction-worker, and various office drones.  I suppose that's part of the charm of the show.So enjoy this year of Melrose bliss before the addition of Heather Locklear, crazy stalker girlfirends, backstabbing manstealing sisters, et. al.  While future seasons were more catty and fun, it's this first season that hooked me for being geniune, sometimes smart, and often sweet.
1	Young Ana Garcia takes on her mother and the world. The surprise in "Real Women Have Curves" is not that Ana Garcia (American Ferrera) is able to get into a first rate college, given that she is the daughter of a poor Latino family in East L.A., because we buy that she is smart enough. But given her family, it is rather surprising that she dares to dream the dream. Certainly it is nothing that was every discussed around the dinner table in the Garcia family. Her father, Ral (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) is a gardener and her mother, Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros) makes dresses at the sweatshop run by Ana's sister, Estela (Ingrid Oliu). Her mother dismisses out of hand the idea that Ana can go to college and insists she come to work at the dress shop. Although Ana's teacher, Mr. Guzman (George Lopez), continues to encourage her it is not until Ana endures working in the sweatshop for a while that she becomes desperate enough to sit down and write that college application essay.While the story of this 2002 film begins with a young girl graduating high school and ends with her on her way to college, as the title of "Real Women Have Curves" should indicate, this is really about notions of self-worth and body image. Estela's shop makes dresses that are sold for ten times what they are paid on consignment from a big company that is exploiting their cheap labor. Despite her overbearing mother, Ana has enough brains to know exploitation of the workers when she sees it and enough self-confidence to challenge the way of the world for all the good that might do anybody. But then another idea becomes more important as Ana gets her co-workers to wonder why big women (the size of say, cows, hippos, elephants and orcas) should not get to wear beautiful dresses cut to their own figures. The best scene in the movie is when Ana is sweating to death in the dress shop and decides being comfortable is a worthy goal. The next thing we know the ladies are comparing their bodies and driving Ana's mother absolutely crazy.This was originally a play by Josefina Lopez, who worked on the teleplay along with George LaVoo for this film directed by Patricia Cardoso ("El Reino de los cielos"). The flaw that most stands out in this film is that having created an ideal with regards to a beautiful dress for a real woman with curves, we never get the payoff, even though such a dress materializes. This is rather disappointing seeing as how the dress becomes pivotal to my deconstructing of the film, but while I endorse the ideological sentiments of the film regarding female body image I am obviously not in a position to do so from personal knowledge, which may well indicate that I am off base here.This DVD has a pair of above average commentary tracks, the first with actresses Ferrera and Ontiveros, and the second with the director and the screenwriters. Since all are committed to the message of the film, they actually discuss the importance of what is going on and how such issues resonate in their own lives and careers (especially in terms of Lopez), rather than simply telling stories of what happened on the set and other sundry topics. Ferrera is clearly the star of this film, and her performance is a winning one whatever problems we may see with the teleplay, but for those who were introduced to Ontiveros's talents on "Desperate Housewives" it is certainly nice to see here playing a more completely fleshed out (so to speak) character, and her participation in the commentary track is equally as strong. In the end the key thing is that this film is not merely for Latino women, but all real women with curves, and if this film teaches them anything it is to make sure they are exposed to its rhetorical position when they are still young
1	A clever, gripping film. This film keeps you waiting for the big event, and when it happens it's such a twist you're left shaking your head.A must see for anyone who likes good, solid suspense films
1	AN AWESOME REAL STORY PORTRAYAL AND... ...all of the actors and actresses did a SUPER fine job!!!! This was the first movie I ever saw with Cher as an actress and I really was impressed with her acting, as I was with all the others. This is a movie that yes will bring tears BUT also makes you really think and hits the heart chords and nerves. What happened to those people in the real story is portrayed in this movie EXCELLENTLY! This is a MUST HAVE
1	Two thumbs up!. Undoubtly David Mamet lived a glorious decade in these eighties. House of games , the untouchables a scripter and this one.Don't wonder if this movie belongs to cult movie status. It's a witty comedy about an inept , poor experienced and low level gangster who suffers the consequences of his acts when he goes against the orders to take an old shoe - shine boy on one last fing  just before the latter goes to prison being not guilty.Notice this disfunctional state of mind of this rookie gangster,  follows the ancient rule about the wisdom of the experience , despite this statement is not always true all the times , but it does in this case.The laughable side about the sordid universe that surrounds the underworld has been so irreverently told as in this case.Don Ameche (Coccon) and Mantegna (House of games and Alice) give a fine performance.Don't miss this funny comedy. A winner film
1	One of the best action films from this era!. This review is for the 2005 Warner Brothers DVD.The movie opens in a Texas prison where Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) is doing time for armed robbery. He is denied parole and has to come to terms that the only way to get out early is to bribe a prison board member, Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) by indulging him with sexual favors with McCoy's wife Carol (Ali McGraw).  The dirty deed is done and McCoy is then paroled, but Beynon coerces Doc into doing one major bank job with a collection of other crooks that Beynon has assembled.  This sets up a big heist with several twists and turns along the way for an action packed film.I've seen just about all of McQueen's movies and this is my favorite.  First, I like the opening scenes in a real Texas prison.  The guards and other prisoners aren't actors - they are the real deal.  This rest of the movie is shot in Texas also.  I don't recall seeing a single scene that appeared to be  made in a Hollywood backlot.  The plot of this movie is original.  It's more than just a bank robbery and car chases.  There are a series of interesting confrontations and slick double-crosses that add a lot of pizzazz to the film.  The street-smart character of Doc McCoy played by McQueen is what sets this apart from most action films.  His uncanny knack of figuring out what's going on and eluding his advisories is what makes it an extra special movie.  Ali McGraw is beautiful, but her acting is suspect at times.  Sally Struthers gives a wonderful performance as a ditzy, yet too sympathetic hostage.   Slim Pickens also does a stellar job as an older, but very spirited cowboy.As for the DVD, the widescreen color presentation is near pristine.  The stereo audio quality is excellent.  There are plenty of commentary features on this DVD.Movie: A-DVD Quality: A
1	Entertaining~. It was a great movie and arrived quickly from the date of purchase.  I was very satisfied with my purchase and overall experience
1	Great Movie, Good DVD. Being a masterpiece of the 90s, Reservoir Dogs is a movie I never get tired of seeing. It has everything that makes for a great guy flick. It has action, an intriguing story and tons of bad language. One thing that sets this movie apart from other movies is that they show that these robbers are more than criminals who care about no one or no thing, but these guys are strong like brothers and actual friends, which ultimately leads to their downfall. The acting in the film is just what I like. Tim Roth does excellent as Mr. Orange, and you really believe he is in pain the entire time. Steve Buscemi is the sarcastic Mr. Pink that provides a little of the comic relief of the film, even though he is being serious the entire time. It is just the personality of these characters that makes this film go by quickly and make everyone who watches this movie wish that it went on for another thirty minutes at least! For a debut film from an unknown director at the time, Quentin Tarantino does a remarkable job in front of and behind the camera; it is easy to see that he was going to be big.The box itself is something any collector would want, it looks and feels like a gas can which is a reference to the scene when Mr. Blonde tortures the cop. The top comes off easy to reveal the real DVD case which is made to look like a match book. The special features are a hit and miss, which kind of dragged this DVD to four stars instead of five. There are great things on this disc that are great, such as the stories told about Lawrence Tierney, but a couple of other extras on the DVD are sub-par. Such as the tipping guide, which is nothing more than a page that tells how a few characters would tip, depending on the amount of money. No videos, no sound, it is nothing that needed to be included.The deleted scenes and interviews with QT, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are great things that I'm glad where added to the DVD. Then there are interviews that have nothing to do with the movie Reservoir Dogs. There are also no behind-the-scenes documentaries or nothing in detailed is said about the movie itself. Everything said about the movie is either about how it was received or what impact it made in cinema. One of my favorite extras on the DVD is "Profiling the Reservoir Dogs", which a narrator gives a little insight to the past of Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Brown. It is very interesting and informative, but you can't really take it to heart since it feels more like speculation instead of real facts about the characters.Overall, if you love this movie, get this DVD! Like I said, the extras feel like a hit or miss, but it is still worth while because there are a few hours worth of extras-whether they be good or bad.
1	Extremely Funny. All I got to say is this guy is hilarious! His ability to imitate people, music, and other sounds is what really makes him funny in my opinion. If you like laughing, then buy this dvd.
1	Not too easy, not too hard. Easy to follow.  Not a lot of chatter.  It really works you out. Intermediate level. Great workout. WOW
1	One of my favourite films. Franois Truffaut's first film in the English language still stands up well, in my opinion. It is a very fine adaptation of Ray Bradbury's book.I wonder what it says to us today? Possibly quite a lot. The world in which the story takes place does look, superficially, inviting. Maybe this is what it means to be living in a police state? Guy Montag, played with great style by Oskar Werner, is a cool character (and forget the moronic American meaning of the word "cool" here), in that he isn't passionate and lives a rather passionless life. Millie Montag, his wife, is played by Julie Christie, who also plays the role of Clarice.The film is powerful because it rarely overstates its case and keeps the violence to a minimum.The film was "futuristic" in the mid-sixties, when it was made, and it does have a decidedly '60s look about it now. However, it does present us with a people who have forgotten books and get their kicks from very large -interactive TV screens - not that that would ever happen, would it!
1	Good Old Movie. Love this movie, kind of old but always good to watch it
1	Dummy is one smart movie. Dummy is one of those movies you go in not expecting to like, but you wind up falling in love with. A quirky comedy with an offbeat sense of humor it'll have you laughing so hard your stomach will hurt. I'm so glad I didn't miss this intelligent clever comedy. It's one of the best movies I've seen in years.Dummy follows the story of Steven, a shy late twenties man who lives with his dysfunctional parents and bitter sister. Fired from his dead-end job he decides to buy a ventriloquist's dummy and embark on his lifelong dream of becoming a ventriloquist. He goes down to the unemployment office and becomes attracted to his counselor Lorena on the first meeting. (I love how they're both wearing the same bland outfit; a wonderful comment on the stifling conformity of the workplace.) The dummy becomes an extension of Steven's personality and helps him overcome his shyness. With the help of his foul-mouthed tomboy friend Fangora he starts to pursue a romance with Lorena. Despite a series of blunders, (I love the scene where Fangora goes to the unemployment office. It's so funny it'll make you cry, ditto the crazy scene where he spray paints a thank-you note on her door) Steven manages to go on a few dates with Lorena. Just when things are about to get close, she breaks it off with Steven. He thinks it's his weirdness, but it's her own fears of failure in past relationships that cause the separation. At a Jewish wedding Fangora and Steven perform at, things reach a climax as he overcomes his shyness to win the woman he truly loves.This is a great movie; like another one of my favorite movies, How U Like Me Now it uses a simple story as a platform to develop complex multileveled characters. Each character in Dummy struggles to overcome a fear inside themselves and it's ironic that these inner struggles contrast the exterior personality they express. Steven is shy on the outside, but his dummy's alter ego is extremely confident. Fangora is a foul mouthed extrovert but is extremely withdrawn when confronted by her mother about her Jewish heritage. Lorena is a woman who is the picture of stability and secure on the outside but is extremely insecure. Steven's sister Heidi is a wedding planner who can't maintain a relationship. Steven's mother always comforts everyone with food because she can't express her emotions in a constructive manner. Steven's father spends most of his time making model ships of past wars but is afraid to confront the turmoil in his own home. Each of the characters with the exception of Steven's parents find true happiness when they embrace the inner parts of their personalities they have conflict with and pursue their dreams Steven finds happiness in his ventriloquism, Fangora when she embraces her Jewish heritage by performing traditional Jewish songs, Heidi when she sings at the reception and Lorena when she stands up to a former boyfriend.Director Greg Pritkin creates well-crafted film. He tells the stories of all these quirky offbeat characters beautifully. It's easy to identify with each of them and their struggles; being shy myself I could particularly relate to what Steven was going through in his life. Production values on Dummy are top notch. I especially love the cinematography; I felt like I was walking on those suburban streets. The screenplay is well written with some hilarious lines too good to spoil.The acting in this film is some of the best I've ever seen. Adrien Brody is in top form as Steven capturing his shyness (he even does his own ventriloquism) beautifully. Mila Jovovich gives the best performance of her career as Fangora. She steals all the scenes she's in; I wish she'd do more films like this instead of fanticrap like Resident Evil and Fifth Element. A few more quality films like Dummy would elevate her into the A-list where she belongs. Jessica Walter and Ron Leibman are hilarious as Steven's parents. Vera Farmiga gives a strong performace as Lorena. She plays the counselor with great depth expressing her fear and insecurities. Illeana Douglas is brilliant as Heidi. You feel all her frustrations but understand where she's coming from. Jared Harris is extra creepy as Heidi's greasy accountant ex-boyfriend.Dummy is a top ten Shawn James essential video. Pick this one up along with the Clockwatchers How U like Me Now, two other great independent films.
1	Great beginner tape. I have to have a light aerobic tape and this is a good one.  The low impact cardio is similiar to Leslie Sansone but without the obnoxious chatter.  I loved the upper and lower body workouts as they have short reps on each exercise - each segment is only 8 minutes long.  I wish I could create my own workout and play it, like in Denise Austin's latest walk DVD.  Instead I have to play each segment, go back and pick out what I want next from the menu and then play it, or I can just pick the "play all" choice. Highly recommended to the beginner!
1	Great workout for BEGINNERS. I am amazed that the reviewer Cheryl is busy saying how weak the workout is and is only suitable for "beginners"   Maybe Cheryl needs remedial reading before writing reviews.  The title is Abs Yoga for BEGINNERS"  Its a good workout, I ve used it off and on for years and it will tighten up you abs after some regular use
1	Great Yoga for when You're Absolutely Alone. I loved this yoga--it left me with the tingly tired delicious feeling I get sometimes from bow pose. This is the real "heart" of yoga, I feel, apart from the desire to get a workout and a nice body.However, I definitely wouldn't want to be seen doing some of these poses by anyone! Though I do many types of strenuous yoga, I couldn't do everything here fully and it was kind of humbling--this is full of those exercises that look easy but really aren't. I borrowed it from the library and will definitely add it to my collection
1	Irish Angels. Non-stop entertainment.  The only thing better would be to have been there.  The music, the costumes, the singers, the fiddle player, the castle setting were all just wonderful.  I also bought the CD but the DVD far outshines the audio only disc.  These Celtic Women look almost as angelic as they sound.  Angels with Irish accents
1	Amazing show, amazing band. This Live show CD/DVD is an excellent illustration of this band's qualities.  With great lyrics and fantastic melodies, HATB are one of the best band's to survive the 90's rocket to fame.  This CD/DVD combines classics tunes from the 90's as well as songs from their latest ablumn, which are fantastic to hear.  If you ever liked HATB, pick this item up and discover why this band continues to impress
1	"Live life and be happy". A film of jaw-jopping beauty and deeply held poetical lyricism, Deepa Mehta's spectacular Water - the final installment of her devastatingly beautiful Indian trilogy  - is a film of overwhelming tragedy, a gorgeous homage to the country of her birth and a real testament to the resilience of her people's spirit.Steeping her story in Indian spirituality, Mehta sets her atmospheric film in 1938 Colonial India during Gandhi's rise to power. Times are changing for this country that for so long now has only known British rule. New laws are being passed and the young - particularly the men - are gradually opening to the new ways and becoming more liberal minded.Change, however, seems far from the young Chuyia (Sarala) when her father drops her at an ashram for widows. A child bride and married for economic reasons, her much older husband unexpectedly died. Now considered a financial burden by her family she is sent to a house where she is forced to live a life of rigorous penitence and is never allowed to remarry.Here she meets the Madame of the house Madhumati (Manorma), a hugely fat and authoritarian woman in her mid-70s, who runs the house like a nazi, lauding it over all the other women. Of course, Chuyia has a hard time adjusting to this new life of singing religious hymns every day, wearing only white and begging on the streets for money.People avoid them like the plague; many Hindus believe that if they bump into a widow, they will be polluted and must do rituals of purification. Chuyia doesn't really understand any of this, but she has a sharp tongue and her rebellious instincts upset the other widows who reside in this decrepit two-story dwelling built around a court and overlooking the river, most probably the Ganges.Soon the child befriends Shakuntala (Seema Biswas), a kindly woman who struggles to calm the girl down even as she herself struggles with issues of faith and self-worth. But it is to the young and beautiful widow Kalyani (Lisa Ray), whom Chuyia is most drawn to.Through Chuyia, Kalyani meets Narayan (John Abraham), a law student and Gandhi nationalist who is from a wealthy Indian family is an ardent believer in the civil disobedience campaign of Mahatma Gandhi. Narayan falls in love with Kalyani and their romance plays out against the backdrop of the rainwater and the sacred water of the Ganges where people bath, do rituals, and send the ashes of the dead.Narayan promises to take Kalyani away and marry her, but the ancient Indian faith is very firm about widows remarrying. And although a new law has recently been passed - supported by Gandhi - the men who still have the power are intent to ignore laws that cause inconvenience to them.Mehta totally steeps her film in the social and political - and even religious - ramifications of the day, with Gandhi - and the promise of reform always in the background. This leader has begun to speak against the harsh treatment of women and the caste system, angering Hindu fundamentalists. But to the widows and other outcasts, he is a guiding light and a symbol of hope.Lush and full of atmosphere, Water contains some of the most unforgettable images of startling beauty. Indeed the calm magnificence and spirituality of the landscape - the constant ebb and flow of the water - makes a violent contrast to the oppression these widows must face, all in the name of religion.The impact is devastating and to think that these women, are even today, forced to follow chauvinistic religious rules that were put in place thousands of years ago by texts that are still treated as revered and sacred. Mike Leonard August 06.
1	ANIMATED BUT STILL A HARD HITTING PROPHETIC PARABLE. ANIMATED BUT STILL A HARD HITTING PROPHETIC PARABLE ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION ---IN A NUTSHELL:I have just enjoyed "Animal Farm", the animated feature, for the first time and I was truly impressed. Its stark animated realism, augmented by its dispassionate style of narration, gave the film a sense of inevitability which added to its weight as a 20th century parable, created from the famous work by George Orwell.WHERE THE FILM GOES: "ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS!"As most people point out, it is a slightly simplified and more upbeat [in the finale] rendering of Orwell's original literary work, but it is still rather hard-hitting and prophetic. Nevertheless, the personifications of farm animals turned into historic figures like Napoleon the Pig are startling depictions, and mirrored much of what happened in the 20th century, concluding with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.LESSON: ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY?!Neatly depicted are the "Commandmants" which, as the ruling pigs evolve and change hands, begin to be broken by simply revising them to suit the needs of the MORE EQUAL ANIMALS. Ultimately, the reasons for the original revolution -- a desperate need to end the horrible conditions that were brought about by the exploitation of the many by the few -- repeated in the stunning finale. The results are rather predictable, but maybe they weren't when Orwell wrote the book. In any event, it seems to be a parable which needs to be brought frequently to our attention as humans, not just to the animals that are more or less equal to their neighbors in the barnyard.
1	WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET A REMASTERED CUT??. I give this movie 5 stars.  Outstanding story, outstanding performances from the entire cast, an unforgettable climax..everything working together as only Capra could do it!!  I enjoy watching this movie at Christmas time.  Cooper and Stanwyck were teamed twice in 1941...for this..(and for Ball of Fire).  They have great on screen chemistry and both turn in bravura performances....especially Stanwyck.....who should have won the Oscar in 1941 for her work in three of her greatest performances (Lady Eve, Ball of Fire and Meet John Doe).The only complaint I have is all of the transfers for this superb film have always been poor.  When it was released on VHS every copy of the film was cut from a poor negative.  Why is this?  When are we going to get a good, clear, remastered cut of this fine film???Look for this in the bargain bins at your video store or order it from here....it doesn't matter.  The film is great but the DVD quality is very poor.  It will always be like this until someone decides to restore it and release it in high quality.Whenever you see a DVD that is sealed at a bargain price...beware.....you are most likely getting a poor quality transfer........
1	M. Night's Masterpiece. A young boy has the uncanny ability to see and communicate with the dead....that's pretty intense.  This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanted to pee your pants the whole time.  M. Night Shymalan is one of today's best directors.  The performances by the actors are fantastic and believeable.  The movie has a plot that is totally awesome with an awesome ending.  This is certainly one of my top 10 movies of all time
1	Totally awesome!!!. Awesome College Movie.  My only regret is that I did not see this movie during my college years.  Alas, they have the DVD now!Yay!
1	The most sentimental of Ford's movies... Ford's cavalry trilogy is, in its way, just as much Victor McLaglen's trilogy, for he appears once again in 'Rio Grande', still superbly filling the tough-soft sergeant part, still providing the Ford horse-play comedy element with just a touch of parody, still, one might add, probably fulfilling Ford's own particular vision of revering the heroes who have helped conquer the West...The McLaglen sergeant seems drawn on the spreading of lines, but in retrospect, one realizes that somehow, paradoxically, he has inspired a remarkable degree of realism into the three motion pictures... (They would be not the same without him.)'Rio Grande' has a very strong domestic flavor...John Wayne - a casualty of the Civil War - is a cavalry officer, under strict orders, with great family problems... He's a northerner who, not surprisingly, has left his wife, a southerner, because he obediently did his military duty and burned several southern plantations - including the one owned by his wife's family... Maureen O'Hara - bringing a fitting maturity to her stereotyped assignment in the film - never forgives her husband for burning her plantation, and abruptly takes their son and goes away, effectively ending their marriage...Fifteen years later, Wayne, promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Cavalry officer, attempts to maintain the truce calm at his southwestern post, which is besieged by marauding renegade Apaches who are continually using the border with Mexico as an escape route after their raids, a lost cause since the U.S. and Mexican governments agreed that their military forces will not cross the Rio Grande under any circumstances...He hurries to put down an Indian uprising when his past and his wife cross his path again... He is confronted by a new recruit: his West Point dropout son (Claude Jarman Jr.) and, later, the arrival of his frigid wife, desperate to buy her son out of the cavalry...Everything, domestically and militarily is, of course, resolved successfully and, indeed, predictably, but it is the texture of the film that gives it its enjoyment - the gentle study of the reconciliation of a colonel and his estranged wife; the interplay of a father compelled to send his son on a dangerous mission; the peculiar supporting contributions of the 'beloved brute sergeant,' or the cavalry side-kicks, Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.The three films (even considered singly) give a feeling of frontier military life, however colored by a director's highly personal viewpoint, that has hardly been approached, let alone surpassed...There's a beautiful scene in which Wayne and Maureen are serenaded by soldiers of his troop... We can observe a husband meditating about all that went wrong with his marriage, and watch the inclination and desire that exist in his longing sideways brief look at his wife...With first rate acting and lushly sentimental score, 'Rio Grande' can never be missed... It is the last of John Ford's cavalry movies and the most sentimental...
1	More of the good old Jeeves humor. If you liked the original ones, get them all.  These are just as enjoyable
1	Great for Beginners. My fiance and I are using this DVD to practice for our upcoming wedding. We have viewed other dance tapes but Shawn's are the only one's that show how to lead and follow. The steps are broken down clearly and at a good pace for beginners. The only additional feature that might be helpful would be to view the dancers dancing to music. Customer service is excellent. I have both emailed and called Shawn directly to ask for imput on our "First Dance".We are so hopeful that we can learn to dance with lessons from Shawn and Joanna that I have just ordered a second DVD on Country Dancing
1	Old Fashioned Western Fun. If you like it when the good guys win...when justice prevails...or even just old westerns, this is for you. The color and quality are top notch. It sure looks as if it were shot in the Big Valley. Stars galore are on display here; James Whitmore, William Shatner, Charles Bronson, Bruce Dern, Richard O'brien, Jill St. John, George Kennedy, among others. Then there are the regulars; Lee Majors, Linda Evans, and naturally Barbara Stanwyck. There's lots of action in this set
1	Wizard of OZ (two disc special addition.). A classic must have in your family libary
1	How far we have fallen. To watch what was the first television program which drove itself by way of a moral compass and the concern for the public good, was refreshing and saddening. It felt so nice to see an honest reporter standing up for something despite endangering both his network and himself to do it. Also, it felt sad to know that this was in the 1950s and now...well, now we have FOX. It was Murrow who actually started the ball rolling in the long overdue decapitation of Joseph McCarthy and his fascistic crusaders...now we have FOX. Watch this series and know how far we have fallen, where television's morality and spine are concerned
1	A Time to Think. Grisham once said he wrote his other books, e.g., The Firm, et al., so he could afford to write important books, like this one, upon which the movie s based.  Matthew McConaghey gives a fantastic performance--and why hasn't Hollywood ever--EVER--given him another part this good!  Thought provoking, great acting, great story, highly recommen
1	Heart Pounding Film of Murder for Hire. This is my favorite Bogie film with our hero playing a tough Brooklyn District Attorney who has to find how and why witnesses are being killed. It is not a romantic film like "Casablanca", a cult-classic like "The Maltese Falcon," a social commentary like "Knock on Any Door." It is simply the most suspensful of all Bogie flicks.  The depiction of Mendoza, the man who invented murder for profit, is terrifying.  This is spine tingling film noir with a documentary nuance. Get scared...don't miss it
1	Very Raw, Very Ramones. Before I put Ramones Raw in the DVD player I thought it might seem bittersweet to watch, what with three of the band members now deceased. But instead of making me feel sad, the footage only made me happy that the world ever got to experience this thing called Ramones in the first place.The DVD contains five hours' worth of footage, including concert footage from 1980 to 1996, clips of television appearances (Howard Stern and Uncle Floyd), their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and "I, Ramones," a concert shot in Italy.With exception to concert footage, most of what we see was shot by Marky Ramone on his Super 8 camera. Apparently Marky was determined to capture life on the road for the band and it is his behind-the-scenes footage that makes this DVD worthwhile. The title is appropriate as some of what you see is indeed raw, and it gets a bit confusing at times because things aren't in chronological order.Some of the more interesting footage includes the band's van being mobbed by screaming and fanatical fans much like the Beatles in "A Hard Day's Night," and Johnny sarcastically giving tour manager Monte Melnick a hard time anytime things get chaotic: "Really well organized, Monte. Nice job." Not.We also get to see the usually stoic Johnny actually laugh and joke as well as sobering evidence of Dee Dee's physical and mental decline from drug use as we see clips of a youthful and vibrant Dee Dee and a hardened and somewhat narcissistic one. There are also lots of shots of the boys sitting on the toilet, which they themselves find hilarious.Joey appears to be an easy-going, laid back guy who gets along well with everyone. But the footage suggests, as has been reported since Johnny's death, that he and Johnny did not get along very well after Johnny stole his girlfriend. We don't see the two fight or bicker. Instead, they simply and quietly avoid each other.Diehard fans of  Joey, Johnny, Marky and Dee Dee won't be disappointed with this one. It's a lively snapshot into the life of four ordinary guys whose impact on music was anything but ordinary
1	Crochet Fashions in Motion is Fabulous!!!. What can I say...this dvd is great!!! It has everything you need to start crocheting as a beginner and challenging projects for experienced crocheters as well.  I tried to learn to crochet w/ an instrucitonal book and almost gave up until my friend let me borrow this dvd.  Ever since I purchased it myself from amazon I've been able to learn new techniques and take on new projects like twice a week=) This dvd will mature along w/ you as you get better at crocheting and is soooo fun to knitalong with. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is on the fence about it. Buy this dvd!!
1	I never thought I would say a parody of the great 'The Fugative' would be this good, but Leslie Nielsen, take a bow!. Absolutely hilarious take off on 'TheFugative', 'Braveheart' and 'America'sMost Wanted', with timely cameos bymany, But the late Richard Crenna(Summer Rental ***.5's/Rambo[nehead]movies) steals the show. A PITY hedidn't get to work with his alterego, Tommy Lee Jones! Best Nielsenspoof yet! But don't miss 'Spy Hard'or '2001: A Space Travesty'!!!!!!!!
1	29th Street. This is a classic must see-especially for New Yorkers!This came out way before My Big Fat Greek Wedding. If you liked that movie, you'll love 29th Street.
1	Great Show, but quality of Dvd not great!. We love MASH and own all the previous seasons on DVD, so naturally we wanted Season 9. We had bought it from someplace other then Amazon and returned it because the quality of the shows were not that clear (blurry). So we bought it from Amazon and even though the quality was better, it still was not as good as the previous seasons we own. Seein that its a great TV series and if your not a perfectionist (like my husband) go ahead and purchase this as you will it enjoy it anyways
1	Study in Betrayal and Revenge. This moody Western is a film about betrayal and revenge directed by Marlon Brando. Brando's focus here is on characters. The way they walk, talk, eat, drink, dress, kill and die is poetic, enigmatic and disturbing under Brando's direction. This film is filled with overly beautiful photography and highly detailed sets. A strange and uneasy film it is remains offbeat yet very captivating
1	Soylent Green - Pure Fantasy or Potential Reality. My watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world. The premise of the film was disturbing to say the least. I have never been a true fan of Charleton Heston who in my opinion always has overacted. However, Edward G. Robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played. His performance was truly heartfelt, bringing to mind the current debate on "ending one's own life with dignity". I shutter to think that this is life as it should be though. But Robinson's character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him. I found the other actors to be somewhat bland. Perhaps this was acting at that point in time, but some actors can make the most of roles and others cannot. The story line was unique, but the script was lacking. A re-make today by Steven Spielberg might be worthwhile seeing. Perhaps the most striking element I took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up
1	Not perfect, but when the results are so good, who cares?. "The best of youth" is a wonderful Italian miniseries directed by Marco Tullio Giordana that we can now watch thanks to this dvd. Truth to be told, this is the kind of great opportunity you simply have to take advantage of.Why? Because this miniseries entertains, but also allows you to witness some of the things that happened in Italy in the last 50 years, from the point of view of two Italian brothers, Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) Carati. They are both very different, but thanks to them, their friends and girlfriends we can at the very least have a notion of what happened in Italy during those years. Mafia, floods, terrorism (the Red Brigades), corruption, yes, but also the transformation of two young men from starry eyed teenagers to adults that struggle with reality and its challenges, and find different paths in their lives.All in all, I can say that I loved this miniseries. "The best of youth" lasts approximately 6 hours, but that was not enough, due to the fact that you want to know more about the characters and what is going to happen with them in the future. Of course, this series is far from perfect, but when the results are so good, and manages to transmit so much, who cares?. Highly recommended!Belen Alca
1	a real jawdropper. his film is completely different from what I thought it was going to be:  a sensitive nature outing about a man who researched grizzly bears and advocated for them, only to be tragically killed by them.  Alas!  After reviewing the case, I must conclude the bloke was duly consumed.Yes, folks, this is a movie about one of the stupidest mortals to ever walk the earth in recent years.  Regardless of how you feel about Timothy Treadwell, you'll be completely dumbstruck -- enthralled -- by this movie, masterfully wrought by Werner Herzog.Perhaps you'd like to know:  the audio file of Timothy and Amy being eaten appears nowhere in the film, after the credits, or anywhere on this DVD in the special features.  The woman who possesses this tape (and you'll see her in the movie) hasn't released it to the public.I mention this because many people, I think, might buy the DVD thinking it's going to be on there somewhere.  No, the special features are crud:  no director's commentary, and a 50-minute documentary on the recording of the film's music, which is pretty much snoresville.There are no other special features whatsoever.And I love how Amazon makes it look like Amie Huguenard is "starring" in  it.  Sheesh
1	best double feature of the year !!!. These are two of the best movies that I've purchased this year.
1	This Movie is Over Most People's Heads (Even Though It's D&ck & Fart Jokes). This comedy hits a little too close to home for some. What makes it so classic is that I can actually see this happening to our culture to some degree. Mike Judge is awesome
1	Well done!. This is probably the best dolph lundgren movie ever made. it has everything. you nee to see it
1	FUN and gets you sweaty !!. I do not like aerobics, but I really needed to do some cardio workout, so I found this, and really, IT IS A GEM! The workout is based on very easy Latin dance steps, so it is much more fun than doing plain floor or step aerobics! And you don't need to be a dancer to use it! It is great fun! Try it
1	I don't get mad, I get Lou. Thornton Mellon (the late Rodney Dangerfield) is an American success story.  The son of immigrants, he has worked hard and used business savvy to get fabulously wealthy with his chain of "Tall and Fat" stores (with "a-frames" for the ladies and "The New Hindenberg Line" for men).  But Mellon never made it to college, and now his son (Keith Gordon) is thinking of quitting school, too.  Mellon ditches philandering trophy wife Vanessa (Adrienne Barbeau) and goes 'back to school' as a middle-aged, clueless freshman, to try and help his son.There is a great supporting cast including but not limited to a young Robert Downey, Jr. (roommate), College Dean Martin (Ned Beatty), the Diving Coach (M. Emmett Walsh), and  a snobby foil (Paxton Whitehead). Sally Kellerman plays a surprisingly credible love interest and cameos by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. and Sam Kinnison round out the impressive cast.A good soundtrack and classic academia sets help the film along.  But, in essence, BACK TO SCHOOL is a vehicle for the charming and ever-witty Rodney Dangerfield and his one liners ("The shape I'm in, you could donate my body to science fiction").  Don't expect anything serious or profound in this film, but it's gentle fun, holds up well after so many years, and has a consistently brilliant screenplay
1	I was crying, Laughing so hard that is!. One word for Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu,FUNNY! If you don't laugh at least one time or a MANY times at this anime. Well I feel sorry for ya! heheUnlike Full Metal Panic this series focuses on funny stories. So if your looking for serious drama you won't find it here. I have to give a cheer and hand to the Dub Cast! They all seem to have had a fun time dubbing the show and it shows. My favorite esps are 5, 8, 9 and the last esp was Funny as well. I've heard some people say this show is along the lines as Ranma 1/2. Being a lifetime fan of Ranma I can see why they say that. Anyway FMPF is SUPER Funny and I LOVED IT! Just sit and back and get ready to LAUGH! I'm so happy I got this one!
1	I LOVE THIS DVD. Oh wow one of Styx's most famous concerts for me to see whenever I please. When I got this I flipped out. I couldn't believe it. I was the luckiest man alive. I watched this thing over and over and over and I'm still not tired of it. 17 of their best songs performed live. I particularly liked "Rockin' The Paradise", "Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)", "Lady", "Show Me The Way", "Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)", "Babe", "Come Sail Away", "Renegade", "Lorelei", "Too Much Time On My Hands", "Snowblind", "Miss America", "Crystal Ball", "The Best Of Times", "Grand Illusion", "Suite Madame Blue" and "Boat On The River" those are my favorite songs on this DVD. This is a must have for any Styx fan whther you new to them or you are a seasoned veteran
1	Rare Footage. If you lean towards being slightly more eclectic, this might surprise and delight you. The variety of interviews and stage performances show Jewel's rich singing tradition. She can yodel in her car or perform her music in any setting. When she sings, she becomes the music and there are moments where it feels as if music is as natural as breathing.Jewel's wild vulnerability, the soft pink lights radiating through her hair, the mixture of woman and child all make this DVD especially entertaining and meaningful. If you have ever wondered how a music CD is created, there is insight into the creative brainstorming and you get to see the photo shoot for the cover of the Spirit album.This is ten times more interesting than an unauthorized DVD. Jewel is actually singing and performing on stage. We find her on the tour bus, reading quietly while being filmed, singing in London under a chandelier, standing outside the Inner Change Coffee House where she was discovered. Jewel's brothers also make an appearance and Lenedra Carroll (Jewel's mother) talks about singing to her children and how Jewel grew up in a very artistic and musical family.What fascinating me more than anything is how Jewel adapts a song for the stage and for the audience environment in a smaller intimate setting. This alone shows how she connects with various audiences and how her music truly does appeal to the heart. I loved seeing how she tried to connect with a European audience and how she gradually won them over. This has Benefit Concert footage and you can see Jewel enjoying her trip to London.If you are a Jewel fan researching her history, then you won't want to miss this rare footage.Bonus Songs include: What's Simple Is True, Down So Long and Who Will Save Your Soul.Also look for her books:Jewel: Chasing Down the DawnA Night Without Armor: Poems~TheRebeccaReview.com
1	if your an nge fan...this is the collection. product arrived quickly and in perfect condition, the sound quality was perfect and the video quality was great...the overall condition of the discs was outstanding as well.  already being a fan of this legendary anime, I choose to review the product's condition as opposed to the content of this     thought provoking, controversial, and psychological anime that was maybe before its time.  Since its release, this anime is different than any mecha based themed anime ever made.  being more about the mental state of the drivers of the mecha than about the mecha themselves.  highly recommemded!!!
1	Rockfordphile. Packaging and additional content is mediocre. Fortunately I bought this because I love the series. If you're a Rockfordphile like me, every episode is a must-have. I'm collecting every release
1	Clarification. Just to clarify something: in another review it is stated &quot;at one point, it makes the erroneous claim that Rastafarianism was started by Marcus Garvey, which is not true&quot;. Well, it is true (sort of), although Marcus himself wasn't a rastifarian - a statement (prophesy) he made during a speech, that a &quot;king (of kings) will rise out of Afrika, from the line of David&quot; was what initially sparked the Rastifarian belief, which officially started when Haile Seliassie (a name that came with the crowning - his birth name was Ras Tafari, get it?), 225th in line from the house of David, was crowned as Emperor of Ethiopia. When Burning Spear sings &quot;Macus Garvey words come to pass...&quot; he is reffering to the prophesy..
1	Enjoyable 1950's Style Roman Movie. I will leave the pomposity of the movie critics where it belongs.  This review is that of an ordinary person who has seen the movie many times.  Long before the days of cable TV, this was traditionally shown around Easter on network television.  It is a story of a Roman Tribune who officiates at the crucifixion of Christ, and is transformed by the physical touch of the robe He wore.  Filmed in 1953, it would be done differently today (the same can be said of almost all movies from the 1950's.)  Today's teens will be bored within 5 minutes--given their attention span and need for constant stimulation.  However, if you enjoy historical pieces, in this case Roman civilization in the first century A.D., you will enjoy this movie.  Richard Burton plays the main character, Victor Mature plays Demetrius, his Greek slave.  The story involves Burton's personal inner transformation after overseeing Christ's crucifixion.  Jean Simmons plays his love interest.  Jay Robinson does a great job as the mad Caligula (try to recognize him in a 1992 movie--"Bram Stoker's Dracula").  I found the costumes and sets delightful.  The transfer to DVD is of reasonably good quality and is in widescreen, which I prefer.  The transformation undergone by Burton's character is of course directly related to the Christ and much of the movie relates to the early christians of that time.  Those who are not religious will still find the movie entertaining.  It is not the best acting I've seen Burton do but is acceptable.  Overall, this is a production which can appeal to a wide range of viewers, but those looking for an "American Pie", Teen-Slasher, or "Gladiator" type of movie will be disappointed.  You may also be interested in a movie released a year or two later, "Demetrius and the Gladiators" which is a sequel starring Victor Mature.
1	Top Ten Food Movie. I spent two weeks cruising the Italian neighborhoods of San Francisco looking for a restaurant like the one portrayed so richly in this movie. And I found one! Unfortunately, as might have been predicted from the film, it lasted only a few months before folding.There's more to Big Night than the food. It's outrageously funny, for one thing, a quality many reviewers seemed not to appreciate. The acting is brilliant; for once, everyone acts in ensemble. It's original, not quite any Hollywood genre. It's poignant, in emotional terms most people can find believable. Is it a GREAT movie? Dumb question! It's a movie you'll enjoy and remember
1	Good fun for kids. This was pretty cute and funny, really if I could have I would have given it 3.5 stars, but there's not half star rating here.All in all, it was well put together.. had the vein of fun from the old Scooby Doo cartoons I grew up on. The various worlds they visited during the adventure added to the story and kept you from getting bored of one scenario. I freely admit, I am more partial to the older ones.. they just seem a little more solid to me than the current ones, but overall I think this is good for kids to watch, they would have fun with it and learn a few things along the way.
1	Very good for viewers who don't always need to take sides. What I like most about this film is its characters. There's a Harvard professor, a depressed psychologist, a good friend, and last but not least, a pretty, intelligent girl. Not to mention the main character, a genious with an extensive police record who seems to enjoy getting drunk and fighting on the street.These characters have different points of view, but this does not mean that some of the characters are good and some of them are evil. Everyone has good intentions. But the "right" thing to do doesn't seem to be crystal clear.
1	Coming of Age Story!!. Very cute movie and a lot more fun than I thought it would be.Set in Britain, you have Jess, a teenage girl of Indian descent, keenly interested in playing soccer (or football in Britain) and very good at soccer as well! She idolizes British soccer player David Beckham and dreams of one day becoming a professional player herself! Unfortunately, her parents are very traditional and don't want her playing soccer as girls of her age should no longer be interested in playing sports.Jess secretly joins a girl's soccer team after being spotted by another female soccer player, Juliet, who helps recruit Jesse to play for her team. Jess's parents don't approve, but Jess decides to play on the team anyway and not tell her parents anything about being on the team.Jess excels at playing soccer, enjoys playing soccer as it is her passion, and becomes fast friends with the girls on her team as well as her coach. She also does a lot of funny things in order not to be caught playing on an all girl's soccer team by her parents, but still gets caught anyway. It doesn't help that the coach for the team is a male!Pros: Cute, funny movie, with great storyline about friendship, family, love, and finding the inner strength be fight for what you believe in and following your dream.Cons: Predictable. Hard at times to follow the British accents and British slang
1	USHERS IN NEW ERA OF BRAINWAVE CYBERVIDEO!!. This video hits you with a heroic dose of transdimensional fractallized morphing art! The synchronized musical soundtrack is easily on a par with Jeffrey S. Thompson's wildest brainwave music! AV3X is a BONAFIDE brainwave entrainment device that induces relaxing and meditative states in the theta and alpha ranges. Like a souped-up 21st Century Dream Machine, it sweeps the viewer away on a true cyberdelic experience! I was asleep within five minutes of the first time i played it, but was able to make repeated viewings later. This product evokes a rapid and pronounced relaxation response. It can be meditated to by experienced sound meditators, and can serve the novice by introducing them to sustained "clean wave" states. There are many forms of meditation including entrainment by sound. I recommend this primarily to people who want immediate relaxation and something beautiful to look at. While I have meditated to AV3X, I more enjoy its Journey aspects. The visuals consist primarily of highly detailed and aesthetically impressive computer animation which superimposes "multiple dimensional realities" if you will, on each other so your focus is making vast transitions. By which I mean you could be viewing subatomic, molecular and galactic objects simultaneously, as it were. As your attention shifts amongst  the various elements, you trance out. A strobe effect synchronized to the video and audio is a major cause of the immediate response, I think. It is SO intense i thought i might have a flashback after watching it for a couple of hours. in fact, i think maybe i DID have one! (Your brain adjusts to the strobe effect pretty quickly, so in a matter of minutes it seems peripheral - also, the new edition has a strobe disable feature which would be handy for showing it to other people, since some people initially are put off by it - not me!) This disc is like the lower levels of the psychedelic experience, where one sees all kinds of geometrics and morphing clouds of color, but the BONUS is that one gets entrained by fortune of a savvy use of the latest technology into extremely relaxing and salutary states. After many viewings, it seems to me that there actually IS a narrative movement of sorts which is a story of evolution from the interior view of consciousness moving into solidity, then embodiment, and then into more ethereal forms. Furthermore, the musical accompaniment is a solid and intriguing work of Visionary music that true aficionadoes MUST hear at some point. The genre is thoroughly modern dark Ambient brainwave music which at certain moments hints of rockbeat but never does. The primary wave is sometimes quite pronounced. It is not hard Techno. My use of it has been strictly solitary meditation or casual relaxation, so I can't comment on its party aspects. But it would no doubt be a great group experience with a pot of tea. Not only is Oliver using resonance, primordial sounds, and synthesized curliques, but there is a interesting use of what sounds like overtone singing. Lots of processed water sounds that are similar to the music of Boris Mourashkin (a Russian healing music composer,) challenging but in AV3X's case pleasing and "curiouser & curiouser...." At Last:  somebody has created a visual equivalent for cutting edge brainwave music! Although the price might seem high, if you are looking for instant deep relaxation while you lounge before the television, this will do it far better than low-priced brainwave machines that go for 10 times its price. I wanted to start this review by saying something like "Amaze your friends! Be the first one on your block! Convert your living room into a mighty realm of psychic adventure and ordered chaos!" But i didn't think you'd read this far if I did. lastly: this disc is extremely intense. not for the faint of heart or for anybody who has boundary issues and doesn't want to be swept away by the TV. it is as safe as playing with a strobe light, but is therefore NOT recommended for anybody susceptible to seizures from flashing light.
1	a view from a purely a beginner, an admirer. If you are collecting ballet, this production is highly recommended. If you are a fan of Nureyev and Fonteyne, especially Nureyev, this must be added to your collection. I can only post my honest opinion since I am only starting to be exposed to the great art that is ballet.The costumes and stage settings are on a grand scale, top notch. The color theme is very earthy, except for the prince and the swans. The various guests at the prince's birthday celebrations all dress elaborately and those who study costume design, I must recommend this to you.The way the story is told is mainly from the prince's point of view, and there are a lot of Nureyev's solos. Great solos they are too. So strong and graceful. His high jumps and fierce spinning will catch anyone's breath. However, there was so much of his solo and not Fonteyne's. I felt that this was a little unfair. From beginning to the very end of the death scene, the story focuses mainly on the tragedy of the prince. I must also add, that death scene is one of the coolest thing I have ever seen done on stage!!! I get chills every time.The first appearance of Fonteyne is also a sight to behold. She truly embodies the tragic swan princess. Their Pas De Duexs are not to be missed. Corps de Ballet is also a highlight of this DVD. The swans enter the stage endlessly, and dance like they were one soul. My favorite is the four swans dancing, hand in hand...I'm sorry, I am still studying and I do not know what this is called.This is not a recording of a live production, and therefore, there are no applause between the scenes. This also allows camera angles that would not be allowed otherwise.Classic ballet it is. Swan Lake a ballet lover must have. This one has Nureyev written all over it.
1	Rushmore. Another favorite by Wes Anderson. Mr. Anderson writes a great story and hires the right actors to make it work perfectly. This movie is the only one without Owen Wilson
1	A touch of Old Fashioned Charm. This is a Musical for the discerning. Someone who appreciates the way things 'use to be'. Mr Astaire executes with effortless elegance, grace and 100% charm.A Youthful Leslie Caron almost flawlessly mirrors Mr. Astaire's natural effortlessness and makes you wish that you had enough talent to look so relaxed partnering a legendary entertainer.If you enjoy the innocent/natural charisma of a bygone era with its genteel elegance....you cannot go past this classic!On the downside [purely personal taste] I think that Miss Caron's 'fade to dream dance sequences' are too long and too numerous to hold my attention and don't add enough 'value' to the overall storyline.Ultimately, Uncle Jervis is everyone woman's dream man [fully loaded, without the traditional 'drop dead/georgeous' skin deep covering...but what he lacks in 'looks' is outweighed by his endless charm, charisma and downright Godgiven talent! Delightful!
1	Drop Dead Hilarious!. Drop Dead Gorgeous has been a favorite of mine for years now. I can't even believe how underappreciated this movie was! For shame! It is filmed in the style of a documentary, but it's not real. But the documentary style makes it so different from the same old stuff we see over and over. Throughout the movie, we follow the lives of the girls of Mount Rose as they enter a beauty pageant. Kirsten Dunst is absolutely amazing in this movie. Other incredible performances are given by Ellen Barkin as Kirsten Dunst's white trash mom ("Bring me my smokes!"). You can't help but root for Kirsten's character the entire time, despite you'll love to hate Denise Richards as the daughter of Kirstie Alley, who is in charge of the pageant this year and wants her daughter to win.This is a movie not to miss, and at the price they're advertising it for, you seriously can't go wrong. It is darkly funny and the way to the crown is paved with death. Drop Dead Gorgeous is one of my absolute all-time favorites. I forced friends of mine who'd never heard of it to watch it and every one of them couldn't believe they'd been missing out on it this whole time. It's a wonderfully hilarious and intelligent dark comedy. You'll LOVE it
1	What Causes Zombies?. A sailboat arrives in New York Harbor.  It seems abandoned but a coast guard member is killed by a man on board.  The man is shot and falls into the harbor.  The boat belongs to a man whose daughter is concerned about him.  She and a reporter hire a boat to find her father.  Their destination is an island said to be cursed.  The boat they hire is run by a young couple.  Along the way the couple do some diving (she is topless).  She is scared when she sees a man under the water who attacks a shark and tries to eat it.  She is very upset and somehow loses the rest of her suit when removing her tanks.  The Continue to the island which is just a short distance away.Once on the island they discover researchers looking into a phenomena where the dead rise to attack the living.  Legend says it is the work of voodoo but the lead scientist is convinced there is a medical explanation.  Unfortunately the missing father has already died but at least now it is known.  But soon the zombie trouble gets out of control as cemeteries give up hordes of the walking dead.  In the end, only a few manage to escape the island to head back to civilization.  They keep one zombie as proof that they are not crazy.This is one of the better zombie films although the final battle is a little odd as zombies seem to appear out of nowhere inside buildings.  That aside the story builds nicely with the multiple plots weaving together smoothly.  There is plenty of nudity in this one and plenty of gore, although somewhat tame by today's standards.  The acting is reasonable for the effort and special effects are decent.  I enjoyed the ending which I gather was supposed to be a shocker but which I predicted from the beginning.  My guess is that most viewers will get too caught up in the rest of the movie to think that far ahead, or so the producers hoped.  If you like zombie films you will have to check this one out
1	not great movies but excellent dvd quality. As a huge Cary Grant fan I bought this collection as soon as it came out and I am very happy about it. The 5 movies are not the best films Grant ever made but the dvd quality is very surprising. The movies are in great condition and you could never tell that you're watching films from the early 30's!There is a very good one in the collection though: Wedding Present is a funny and clever comedy, which reminds me of the great masterpieces of the period. If you are a Cary Grant fan or if you love the period my advice is to buy this dvd collection, considering also the low price and the great quality of the dvd transfer
1	Great!. My 10 month old loves this video!  She picked up 3 signs just after watching it for about a week.  If she ever gets fussy we sit her down and watch it with her and she'll calm down and really watch it.  We love it
1	the Postman. I feel this movie was an attention getter, and should have been rated by the media for its content, not it's length.  I would reccommend it to anyone with half a brain
1	Excellent Movie. I was searching for this movie because I loved it when I was young. I came across it being on DVD and I bought it immediately. This is an excellent thriller involving hijacking the subway train and threatening to kill everyone. Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw are excellent actors and make you feel the action going on in the movie. I recommend it to anyone who loves movies about hijacking and killing (over 17 years old that is).
1	A Powerful Courtroom Drama that Still Resonates. The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor & discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men"
1	Fire walk away. The cult show "Twin Peaks" was reknowned for being weird and oddballish, but until fans have seen "Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me," they ain't seen weird yet. Without the restraints of weekly TV, David Lynch allows his unnerving imagination to run wild as it explores what happened before Laura died.It begins with another FBI investigation -- waitress Teresa Banks has been murdered, but not much of the investigation is going forward. Then the investigation is dropped, and the movie  skips ahead a year, showing us the last week of Laura Palmer's (Sheryll Lee) life.In the course of those days, Laura is slowly slipping over to the Dark Side -- drugs, prostitutional sex, and nightmarish visions that are increasingly consuming her life. But as the drugs and sex take over Laura's life, she doesn't realize that a worse fate awaits her -- death, "wrapped in plastic."David Lynch is known for making movies that are absolutely addling. They can make your brain hurt, and sometimes you never understand them at all. "Fire Walk With Me" goes under this heading. At the same time, it makes you think. And think. Like an Expressionist painting, it captivates as it bends your mind.Lynch doesn't follow a real plot; instead, he lets the storyline slowly sink into Laura's downfall. Lynch paints the whole experience with nightmarish, surreal images and visions, and allows it to drip into your subconscious. And along the way, he fills it with slightly offbeat direction, heavy atmosphere, and the ability to make anything -- ANYTHING -- look menacing.It's not exactly friendly to Lynch virgins -- if you don't know what to expect, this will simply tie your head in knots. And though this is a prequel, watch the TV show before venturing in here -- otherwise the appearances by Twin Peaks residents will simply go over your head. (Although it's fun to play "Spot David Bowie").Lee does an excellent job as Laura, careening through the movie with a sense of doom. Laura's not likable here, but Lee keeps her from being a two-dimensional "fallen woman." And Moira Kelly is amazing as her good-girl pal Donna, while Kiefer Sutherland and Harry Dean Stanton have brief but solid roles as the FBI agents.Though reviled when it was released, "Fire Walk With Me" This prequel was the last hurrah of the "Twin Peaks" series, but at least it was a worthwhile one
1	It's a real story. Very Touching, the legacy of the Mirabal sisters is an example of courage. "Vivan las Mariposas"
1	Excellent Workout, Cuing Not Great. Three years I've had this workout...and just until I spent the last three months doing Kathy Smith's Power Step Workout have I been able to complete her "Fat Burning Breakthrough" without losing pace or without injuring myself.The levels, cardio, weightlifting, and "100 Sit-Up Section" are all excellent.  You will see results. You will work your heart and lungs and legs and arms and abs.What is not so good is the cuing. I believe she is going on the premise that you should know what you are doing with a step workout.  However, once you have completed the tape several times, you know what's coming up and can move through all her sets on the tape pretty seamlessly without stopping or saying "huh?" "You want me to do what?"If you are new to step or a novice, purchase her "Power Step" and master it for several months until you are used to a step, and the cardio it brings.  Then, move on to "Fat Burning." She uses some of the same moves in Fat Burning as she does in "Power Step" but at a higher intensity.With these two tapes, I've knocked off about six inches off my thighs, bottom and hips
1	La Traviata. I recently purchased the Salzburg performance of La Traviata with Villazon and Netrebko which blew me away.  However I watched this 1982 Zeffirelli production yesterday and absolutely loved it.  Domingo in the role as Alfredo is magnificent, Stratus too is superb, beautiful voice, great acting and is so "right" for her role as Violetta.I have to admit I cried a couple of times it was very moving.  Bottom line, despite having seen this opera at the Met and La Scala, I have to say this performance is the best ever.  Beautiful production too
1	Ringo Starr!!!!. Ringo is the narrator.  I cannot believe the George Carlin was ever allowed or asked to narrate a children's' series.  I am glad that I finally found a set where Ringo does.Too much repeating of dialogue!After about a month I have found that about half of each episode is just repeated lines.Thomas said, "Oh no I cant stop! Oh no I cant stop."The trucks chuckled, "This is fun!  This is fun."The fat controller said, "Thomas a useful engine could stop.  A useful engine could stop."You get the idea..
1	Watch it! Love it!. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.Read the book if you want the backstory since the screenplay starts at the half point. It's entertaining and that's why we see movies in the first place, right? Matt Damon is just so darn likeable, you get drawn into his narration right off the bat. The screenplay was very well done. It IS a Coppola film, after all...he does work with some talented people. It was very nice to see Theresa Wright in this film, as well.
1	the best anime since cowboy bebop. i love anime, but lots of it cannot hold my attention.  full metal alchemist and inuyasha are dead boring, but this anime is probably the best ever. (tied with bebop)this is a stylish combination of breakdancing and an akira kurosawa type movie.very nic
1	The Last Day. The movie is excellent if you are a Gaspard Ulliel fan but for those that are not, it lacks a climax. The lack of climax works with the script, but proves to be quite boring to watch a movie that leads to nothing. I suggest that this movie either be bought by Gaspard fans or Garcia fans, because unless you like either one or the other, you will not be able to finish watching the movie
1	The original... the best Tarzan of all!. Without a doubt, Johnny Weissmuller's interpretation of Tarzan is the best of all! An excellent swimmer, Johnny Weissmuller makes the swimming scenes seem effortless and believable. Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane provides elegance, as a gentle yet brave and courageous woman, who falls in love with a man, king of the jungle, and yet completely unaware of civilization. The house Tarzan builds for her is a marvel of progress, with the latest technological advancements... in a rudimentary... simple... basic construction. When Edgar Rice Burroughs created Tarzan he played on our survival instincts, and surfaced the innate fears of confronting savage beasts, and yet, the fantasy that we can become friends with all jungle creatures.Tarzan and His Mate- Simply best in class. It explores how life should have been for Adam & Eve... in love, living in paradise, respecting nature, and living in complete harmony with the environment. Not spoiling and accepting the simple things offered by our planet Earth.Tarzan Escapes- From civilization, Jane's cousins visit the Mutia Escarpment, only to realize that she has found true love, family, and home in Africa. The marvel of the home created by Tarzan is highlighted, with the elephant-powered elevator becoming a fascinating process to watch.Tarzan Finds a Son!- Here we meet a new addition to the family, played by Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Both Tarzan and Jane now have a play pal, and he does a magnificent job at allowing the audience to see how we can grow up in this environment and learn survival skills that keep him active, healthy, and self-assured. Great for a younger audience, adding fun and adventure to this wonderful set.Tarzan's New York AdventureOne of the best scenes ever filmed is when Johnny Weissmuller dives off the Washington bridge, and makes it all look possible, doable... and easy. What precision! This movie is fun and Cheetah provides many a laugh. The struggle between good and evil are played to perfection in this series, where those in search for profit and wealth, are always trying to take advantage of the many natural treasures that surround Tarzan's simple life, and it is rewarding to see how the hero never gives in to avarice, defending and maintaining his world in its natural state.We loved the set... and when we visit the zoo... or go to the Circus... we find ourselves looking at elephants and monkeys and saying... "Simba... ungawa!" "Simba... ungawa!" Would highly recommend acquiring this set
1	Earth, Wind & Fire - Live From Japan. This is a must own DVD if you're an EWF fan.  While there are other EWF concert DVDs that may have a better version of "Reasons," overall this was one of their best recorded performances
1	The movie that proves the point that every family is nuts to a degree... I have loved this movie since I was a kid. And it's funny when you're young, but when I watched it again as an adult, it's even more of a gem than I'd previously thought. The movie focuses on familial relationships and centers around Gil (Steve Martin) who is married with 4 kids and trying to work his way up the corporate ladder to provide for his family. It not only shows Gil's relationship with the family he's created for himself, but it also shows his relations with the family he comes from. His 2 sisters, one of whom is married to a man who insists on over-educating their 4-year-old daughter with flashcards of math questions most adults couldn't answer; the other is divorced and has a 17-year-old daughter that's involved in an overdramatic relationship with her boyfriend and young teen son who's quiet and seems to be hiding something. And then, there's their parents, who shower their deadbeat youngest brother with all the attention and glory. Everyone can appreciate some aspect of this film, as everyone has a family of their own. And everyone thinks their own family is the only one that's completely nuts and offkilter...until they see the underworkings of someone else's family and realize that no family is without its' faults. This is a wonderful movie that adults and kids of a reasonable age can enjoy. It's funny yet sweet and reminds us all that if our families don't kill us, they only make us stronger. Definitely recommend
1	A Good Show. I Have read alot of reviews on the carebears show over the last few months and I can tell you that there really isn't a reason for kids to be scared of any of the episodes in this series. I am a collector and own about half of the Dvds with the Origanal episodes, all the movies including the recent new ones, and a bunch of the way origanal Dic Episodes. I have watched them all and I can tell you there is nothing on any of these discs that should really scare your children. but for those of you who might be weary of No Heart and beastly here are some discs that you can get that don't include no heart: "Journey to Joke-a-Lot", "The CareBears Big Wish Movie", and All of the Origanal Dic dvds, most of which are marked with animation station at the top of the disc above the title. I personally enjoyed The CareBears big Wish Movie. but really I think all of the shows involving the carebears are great for kids to watch, (and adults too). I guess if your child is scared easily or something I wouldn't get them the discs with no heart on them but the others are still great entertament. Oh, just to clarify, I personlly thought that this disc and all the episodes on were execellent. I recommend it to everyone who loves the carebears.
1	Northwestener's Required Viewing. I originally stumbled onto this video while routinely watching NOVA.  I sat spellbound and immediately ordered our own family copy.  While this geologic event may seem most meaningful to Northwestern residents, it has some ageless philosophical as well as scientific overtones.  It also provides a glimpse into the extreme natural swings in climate change that happened a relatively short time ago without any influence by man.  And it provides a classic historical lesson that valid scientific conclusions should not be based on a popular vote
1	Double the [fun]. Van Damme and Dennis Rodman in an action movie? Hell Yeah!! Van Damme palys Quinn, the top anti-terrorist of the U.S., who inadvertendly kills the son of super-terrorist Stavros(Mickey rourke), and is sent to an anti-terrorists retirement home as punishment by his superiors. He escapes to reunite with his wife and son, but soon discovers that Stavros has kidnapped them both in a bid for revenge against Quinn. Quinn joins forces with arms dealer Yaz (Dennis Rodman) to rescue his family and defeat the vengeful Stavros. Van Damme is just as quick and powerful as he ever was in this film,Rourke is a nasty bad guy, and Dennis Rodman balances between comic relief and noble hero. It's got all the kung fu action you'd ask out of an action thriller, and is just a fun time at the movies
1	Presented In All Its Original Black & White, Uncut CBS Glory!. This is a GREAT box set of a classic television show.  All 36 episodes are presented just as they aired on CBS so many years ago, in black and white with all original footage intact.  No syndication editing or horrid Turner colorization here!  The prints are very clean and crisp, too.  They look nowhere near 40+ years old.Also included here is the original version of the pilot with some different actors/characters that sold the show to the network but was never aired until 1992, albeit in a shortened version.  There is commentary by creator Sherwood Schwartz on the pilot, too.It's too bad that there was no involvement by Bob Denver on any of the three season sets for "Gilligan's Island".  All of them were released before his passing last month, so it would have been possible.  If only we had a little commentary from him or a short interview with him reminiscing about the role that will make him live forever in our minds, but I'm afraid that it didn't happen.Rest in peace, "Little Buddy"
1	Street Fighter is Chiba-tastic!!!. Critiquing the plot of this movie is pointless,likewise the acting,writing,cinematography etc. It's just one great fight scene after another. All the extraneous elements,such as the aforementioned few, are boiled away,leaving the distilled, pure essence of martial arts movies. But a little known fact is that Chiba studied directly under MAS OYAMA, creator of kyokushinkai karate. This is one nasty art. It cultivates the spirit but also emphasizes raw destructive power. The teacher character in the movie is an homage to Oyama, a genuine Master in the world of martial arts. So, at least one of the characters is based on a real person. Pretty cool!
1	U2 on Joshua Tree tour - it`s worth seeing!. U2`s trip through America performing songs from Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum. The DVD is interesting, though uneven. Worth attention of any rock music enthusiast or a U2 fan, even if only for the performance of Sunday Bloody Sunday on the day of Enniskillen bombing which is a great performance
1	My favorite movie EVER!!!!. Kasi Lemmons is phenomenal as director, she also wrote it! The movie is well acted and written. Oscar worthy performances by Jurnee Smollett and Samuel L. Jackson. Excellent cast, Debbi Morgan owned the role of Mozelle! Jurnee Smollett really evolves into a great actress!In the film, Roz(Whitfield)is a devoted mother of three who can't admit that her marriage is falling apart due to Louis' (Jackson)philandering ways. The youngest daughter and middle child Eve(Jurnee Smollett), witnesses her father having an affair. Desperate to make sense of what she witnesses, Eve turns to her older sister Cisely (Meagan Good) who puts a creative twist on what Eve has seen. Still not satisfied, Eve turns to her Aunt Mozelle(Morgan) who warns that if she ever told a soul she'd kill her. Unable to find the understanding she is looking for Eve, turns to Elzora(Carroll) to put an ending to her family's suffering.The film opens with the Batiste having a party at their home where we meet the main characters. We learn that Eve is the middle of three children and is ten years old. Now as the film opens with a voice-over of adult Eve giving background to the movie, she starts by saying, 'Memory is a selection of images some elusive others printed indelibly on the brain...'which lets us know that the whole movie is from a recollection of a child. The events are seen through the eyes of ten-year old Eve.You immediately see the bond between Cisely and Louis instantly. She is the epitome of a Daddy's girl. Eve 's particularly close with Mozelle. She confides in her about what she has seen. Poe and Roz are close. All the children have a close relationship with an adult.There were so many scenes in the movie that screamed volumes but they were no words. We saw the relationship between Cisely and Eve when they were sitting on the chaise, after the storm and Roz hit Cis. When Cisely put her finger to her lip signaling to eve to keep quiet. The spider on the window when Mozelle and GrayRaven were kissing.(Mozelle was known as a black spider, because all the men she married died.) Amy Vincent was in charge of photography and she did an excellent job at capturing the Bayou, alot of great shots in the film.
1	A GREAT FEEL GOOD MOVIE. This will not be an Oscar winner but it is one that will be there for you when you had a bad day or when winter gets to you !!!!In the league of Full Monty it is all predictible.It is funny - soft and the actors are good looking too.A very good quality / feel good movie a good little wine and pizza to go with it  PERFECT.And you don't have to be a footy fan to enjoy !!!
1	Rock of Ages. ALthough nost of the videos on this DVD are on other Def Leppard releases the commentary and personal play order make this an important addition to your collection
1	Excellent workout!!. This is such a great workout! I love it!I just started doing Pilates and absolutely love the Pilates for You videos. I started with the Beginner, and then moved to the Intermediate. Unlike others I've seen, Sarah Picot explains each of the steps very clearly - so, I'm able to follow along.I've already started to see the difference - I'm getting in better shape! Thanks for such a great series!! I'm really enjoying them!
1	Women willing to carry things over the edge.... Well, if you need a mega dose of sex and violence to get the attention brought to an important issue - then be it.  I believe the message of this movie, and the reason it was banned in France is the emasculation of the male... Yes, there is a graphic rape scene. Yes, the girls also kill women. But I believe it goes much deeper than that. It addresses the underlying message of what is also beginning to happen in the world today. Women are saying enough!For so long we have been seeing so much graphic sex and violence on screen, and rarely is it even discussed...  Here the people who perpetrate the sex and violence are young women, so several alerts go off based upon our cultural and societal conditioning. Now when you consider that all of that conditioning has a very dominant patriarchal and masculine slant, you see most obviously why this film presents so many problems to the viewers...Again, in this film, the people who perpetrate the sex and violence are young women. Alert #1, that is just unacceptable in a patriarchal society.We hear a dialogue between the girls about and show menstrual blood. Alert #2, that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society.The women like sex, in their words, they like to f*@k. Alert #3, that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society.The women appear to use or violate or rape the men that they encounter, and then throw them away (or kill them). Alert #4, that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society.They laugh and joke after on of the girls vomits into the lap of the male she just performed oral sex on. Alert #5, that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society.They kill a man on the roadside who speaks in a vulgar way to them. Alert #6, that is just unacceptable in patriarchal society.These are just a few examples of the intolerance of this film by so many.In short, I think that most people cannot handle this film because it shows the raw feminine, Amazonian power of these two women who have had enough of taking the "normal" and "acceptable" crap that women must deal with on a regular basis and everywhere.The male viewers will get a mental castration with this film and they probably deserve one.  Does it make you uncomfortable that women can also be sexual predators? Does it make you uncomfortable that women can also be cold killers? Does it make you uncomfortable that they are not ashamed of who they are and what they do?If so, and your problem exists because they are "girls" who are doing this, then it sounds as though you are a big part of the problem on the planet today.  If this was your typical buddy film where the characters were men, who went on the very same rampage as these two women, this film would be mainstream and considered "normal".Therein lies the lesson and the powerful message of this movie.  If you think that a "family man" should not be shot on the side of the road for making a "harmless" remark, think again... Especially if that "family man" happens to believe that he has any right to say the following words to two young women walking by: "how would you like to feel my balls slapping against your a**".Does he deserve to get shot? I believe, Yes.  Why? Today it is a fantasy or comment on the side of the road. Tomorrow it is a strong urge. The day after it is a rape. And this man is a father? I wonder how he will "train" his own daughters.  People hate this movie because it shows men for what they are, rude, vulgar, desperate, pigs. And why do people REALLY have this film, because the women call them on it. They rub the viewers faces in it...  what "man" can handle that?Women have been on the receiving end of violence and sexual predators for thousands of years and if the sole message of this film is that women will not take it any more, it succeeds.... Bravo!
1	This will make you laugh & cry. If you can watch this film and not laugh at remembering what it's like to be in the 5th grade, and also not cry tears of joy, then you've lost touch with your emotions.This is at once a lighthearted documentary of pre-teens learning to ballroom dance, and a spectacle of competition as fierce as any Olympics finals you've ever watched. One young couple in particular, who dance the merengue, is mesmerizing. While most kids that age are awkward, uncoordinated, or painfully shy, when these kids dance it's as though they've been professional ballroom dancers for 30 years. Watching the dance competition judges react to these kids is as much fun as watching the kids
1	These DVDs are a MUST HAVE!!. My son loves the bright colors, moving objects, toys, animals, and music
1	My Twins Love It!. I have 4 yr old fraternal twin daughters and they both love Dress Up Days.  We own all of the Strawberry Shortcake series and this is one of their favorites.  Can't comment on the quality of the DVDs since we have VHS only
1	True to Life. Troy Kell is very charming, intelligent, .... yet also A cold blooded killer.  It is a very realistic look into the US prison system.  The death in this movie, is hard to watch- you'll be blown away that it was allowed to contuine for so long.  AFter spending the last 2 years working in the prison system, this film shows a realistic view as to the daily life there
1	nice watch. Peter Parker an ordinary high school kid is bitten by a genetically altered spider. From this point his love for next doors Mary Jane takes a back seat to his new web spinning skills. Nearby his best mates dad takes an experimental serum making him into The Green Goblin. The stage is set for Spider to do battle with Goblin.The CGI and animatio was amazin. Some of the fight scenes where good, but for some reason some of them where kinda funny. The end fight scene was a bit borin. Spider-man just kept on fallin down, what was the all about.It was a good action film but still smth not right. Its just hard to believe that Peter made the Spiderman suit himself. How the hell did he made it and kept in secret?
1	Action Packed. This is an excellent action packed movie that should keep you riveted to your seat if you love adventure. The characters are well developed and the action is marvellous. The special effects were superb.This is good entertainment that is well worth viewing. However, some of the scenes are very violent, therefore not suitable for the very young.
1	Disorganized Criminals...................................... I have to admit that I also LMAO!Hubby came home telling me that he had a movie with members from the ROC and I was very skeptical especially after viewing State Property (((YUCK)))Kevin Hart has an annoying voice, but he is semi funny as he pokes fun at himself!Vicariously seen through the eyes of Shawn a parolee who is desperate to just try keep the electric and gas running and his son off the bowls of cereal at night. As his options are none he decides to go into B&E with his eccentric crew!I'm telling you Capone, Beanie, Damon Dash and Memphis Bleek had me crying! I didn't see the point of Stacy Dash, but I loved Tiffany and Angie in here.Funny movie...
1	Wow! One of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie is pitch perfect in almost all respects.  It is beautiful to look at,the parts are all well cast and the acting is brilliant.  The happy redeeming ending made me feel good about myself and life though it comes after several tragic events. Some important themes are well examined in the plot and though melodramatic the story is well told and holds the viewer's interest throughout. I had to read the book after seeing the movie and was surprised how very faithful the movie was to it.  The book and movie really enhance each other!
1	Outrageously powerful in truth and suffering. This is a cult film in many ways even if time is making it a lot less poignant than it used to be. It is definitely a denunciation of the Cambodian caper of President Nixon. The bombing and then the invading of Cambodia were neither justified nor in any way effective. The Vietnam war was lost when Nixon decided to invade Cambodia and this invasion spread American troops and military means over two wide a territory to even pretend the war was not lost. The invasion of Cambodia was the last straw that broke the camel's back. We could wonder today whether Kissinger let Nixon do this mistake to bury him in this war and thus enable himself to negotiate some kind of a peace agreement. An American journalist lost in this chaos and overwhelmed by the arrival of the Khmer Rouge in Phnom  Penh was a witness to this senseless and absurd caper or continuation of a ridiculous war. But he had to use the services of a local journalist to be the interface between him and the locals. Unluckily this Cambodian journalist stayed too long and he could not escape from the claws of the Khmer Rouge. Then it is a story of resistance and resilience to survive the most horrendous conditions. He will manage to escape absolutely alone though he had started in a group of six or seven. Even the child he had been entrusted with will die along the way blown up by a mine. This is a true story, a testimony about one of the most astounding catastrophe and tragedy of our modern world, a war unjustified and lost even before being started waged by the USA in a country that they did not even know leading to one of the worst ever genocide in modern history performed by the Cambodians themselves onto the Cambodian people they made regress to some medieval state in just a few months and for a few years that lasted centuries. We westerners love exporting our worst nightmares to foreign countries and some of us never learn a lesson and are always ready to do better than some others before us. If the French lost the Indo-chinese war in 1954 there was absolutely no reason why the Americans could win it. If the French lost the Algerian war in 1962 and the British lost the Middle East and Egypt quite some time before there is absolutely no reason why the Americans could do better. This film is a testimony to the suffering the vanity of some of our inspired western leaders imposes onto millions of people around the world. For one case that ends with a little bit of joy, millions of cases end in plain death.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
1	Requires Active Viewing Participation. This is a singular masterpiece in film making but totally unlike anything, even for it's day.  By today's attention deficit disorder standards, this film is really really odd.  But no doubt it is a masterpiece if the viewer is willing to put the effort in to catch all the nuances because this is a film of nothing but nuances.  Tati himself is just one of many participants.There is a plot of sorts dealing with a group of female American tourists and the one women who is the odd duck among them.  She meets Tati and they spend the night together dancing at a night club and see in the dawn at a coffee shop.  Various bits of business are constantly swirling around them and you could view this picture 10 times before seeing everything.  There are many jokes but they are gentle visual puns.  Don't expect belly laughs, just a wry but amazing view on modern life.As is standard practice for Criterian these days the extras on disc two are spectacular.  The documentaries on Tati's life and this film are brilliant and helped me understand his art and this film much better.A gentle film with brilliant use of wide screen (this film would make no sense pan and scan) you need to fall into the picture to enjoy it.  But there is an endless wealth of material to enjoy
1	This movie is Afrolicious!,. I always see this movie as a great Harlem detective story. Shafts pulsate with street-level lingo and a deep sense of conviction you can help but admire. In the great tradition of detective movies Shaft is clearly a hard-bitten loner who spars with friends and foe alike, then gets just what he wants from everyone.Even though "Shaft" was an MGM release it was clearly intended for the black audience Hollywood had always ignored. The attitude of Shaft is what set it apart - it made no effort to court the white audience at all. John Shaft kept his mouth shut for nobody, and wasn't interested in carrying a civics lesson or being an ambassador from an alien race. He was openly promiscuous, keeping at least a couple of steady women on his string, and taking in the occasional admiring prostitute. He talked dirty, told white cops where to get off, pushed around the toughest of the black mobsters, and made mincemeat of adversaries both black and white. A year before "The Godfather," the Mafia of Shaft consisted of fairly accurate Italian goombah types; Shaft had no trouble letting loose with the ethnic slurs either. In other words, "Shaft" was a fresh dose of reality, in 70s parlance, 'telling it like it is.' This script showed no influence of studio influence, whatsoever.Shaft has a good New York look. The overall atmosphere is great, a mixture of dingy, claustrophobic hotel rooms and neglected city streets. A lot of the action appears to take place around Times Square, which was quite a different place in 1970 - much rougher, much more rundown. Shaft must hold the record for the number of movie marquees on view in one film; I'd guess it was filmed in late Summer-Early fall with what's playing in downtown Manhattan. Roundtree fills out the role believably while the surrounding cast work well together, even if the stereotype line is occasionally breached. Several nice moments in the script carry the film over its dull passages, all leading up to a great ending.
1	best teen movie of the 90's. I love Clueless. It's an amazing movie based on spoiled rich kids. The main character is Cher( silverstone), who likes to help out others in the school and likes to get her way. Dion is the funniest character of them all. I like her sense of humor.Mostly a teen could relate to any of these characters. Instead of using their popularity to bring people down, they made the new girl Tie, fill welcome.I'm so happy they made a special edition for ''Clueless.'' The packaging is brillant. Most of the talking was funny. Thanks Paramount for releasing it
1	A Subtle yet Powerful Western. Michael Winner's CHATO'S LAND may seem a bit below standard from other films that he directed but the strength in this film comes from Charles Bronson's stoic performance seen and unseen on the screen. Bronson's presence is there and is inescapable as is the baron land he habitats. The visual forsaken look of the film's characters and landscape makes the viewer wonder what the point of this whole film is.  Whatever Bronson's transgressions may really have been the forlorn posse tracking him are representative of the worst qualities of society. I saw this film when first released but with time I see the deeper social implications and commentary on society that director Michael Winner was making. This is a good Western but may be a difficult one to appreciate on an initial viewing
1	Interesting script!. This script has several points which eventually will engage you. A young couple fascinated by the idea of making easy money; a female cold blood assassin with serious emotional conflicts never resolved from her childhood , supported by dreamingly fly backs ad finally a man who will fall in love with...The mother instinct will work out as a fundamental device and dramatic spring ; both women practically will turn the orders and the male plains.The greed, the violence and the redemption will blend in this dark  picture with Hannah as the merciless murderer without any scruple. Twenty grand is the cipher.Good camera work and an intriguing thriller that gets its aim.
1	Loved My Big Fat Greek Wedding. This movie pictured a sizable segment of the U.S. population that has not gotten much attention in the movies - the high involvement Mediterranean family. Many Italians I know  said that it could have been their family. The movie works so well because the author and star really lived and knew the life she depicted. I enjoyed the wry humor.At the beginning I was prepared to hate her father. He was so sexist and bullying and anti-intellectual. And the women of the family were so cynically manipulative. It did not occur to me until late into the movie that the father was really afraid. He had only the best in mind for his family, and that included his daughters, and that he too felt out of his element in a different mix of cultures that is the United States.One other detail pleased me; the role of the community college in helping people break free from a confining life to move up in the world. Not only do they learn academic things, they meet wonderful people from other cultures there, fall in love, and marry them.The photography was wonderful and the acting was superb, especially since  the movie was made on a tight budget.This is one of the best films I have seen in the past ten years.

1	The Graduate. Would you believe I never watched it before this week? I've missed a lot of classics which I should have seen. So how did this one age? Quite nicely. Fine writing, laugh out loud funny situational comedy, many supporting actors and actresses who I recognized from elsewhere, funny hair, clever satire, solid content, garishly colorful clothes you have to love laughing at. At last I understand why Simon and Garfunkel, who I like, are so overrated. Anne Bancroft immediately became every schoolboy's fantasy, and Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in the starring role. I chose not to have sex as a teenager or a pre-teenager. But seeing Hoffman as a recent university graduate, all I could think was, "Damn, that kid needs to get laid." Even after he got laid. Great movie.
1	Murders in imaginary rural England. Delightful imaginary villages (probably mostly filmed in Surrey) are rocked by series of murders always solved by Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby (who never looses his cool)with the help of his assistant Troy who is a terrible driver.  The dialogue is pleasant, the relationship between the main detective and his assistant is that of kindly master and pupil, the detective work is interspersed with clues, so you can (maybe) guess the culprit, and the scenery is delightful.  What more could you want of a detective series?  I also love the eery theme tune.It has no intellectual pretensions, like a Morse might.  It has no really fast action, like an MI5 has.  It is not complicated like the CSIs. It is not as funny as a Rumpole. It does have some 'ancient history' of characters, like some Agatha Christies. Only drawback: sensitive souls (esp. children) might be a little shocked by some of the gruesome murder scenes - not that you see much of them at all.  All in all, a very civilized detective.In case you are looking for particular episodes, the episodes in this series are: Tainted Fruit, Ring out your Dead (featuring villages Church Bell Ringing competition), Murder on St Malley's Day (featuring an English private school),Market for Murder (about a lady's reading group), and A Worm in the Bud
1	funniest scene ever. I won't belabor the obvious greatness of this classic.  That's legendary.  What I'd like to point out is that the scene with Felix opening his eustachian tubes in the restaurant with the "phmeh" sound is possibly the funniest scene ever filmed.  If you don't laugh out loud at that, you have no soul
1	DVD is not a new production. If you already own the VHS, you may be wondering whether this is a new production, especially since the cover photo appears to be a 40-year-old Dunn.  Wouldn't you like to see the results of some 20 years of practice?  Imagine, too, all the ideas Dunn must have had over the years of what he could have done better on the video.  Well, sorry, it's the same production as on the VHS tape, the same 20-year-old Dunn, the same soundtrack, including the same minor errors in verbal instruction.There is, nevertheless, some advantage in the DVD format over the VHS, if you haven't learned the form yet.  There is a menu, with the form broken down into about 50 short pieces, and it will cycle through a chosen short piece repeatedly until you select "next" -- or you can play straight through the entire form.  If you're like me, you'll use that automatic repetition of short pieces quite a lot, on your way to learning the form
1	"White Heat Goes West". Exciting and well made western from acclaimed action director Raoul Walsh.  It stars Rock Hudson and Donna Reed (looking beautfiul as ever).  A tight pace and thrilling cinematography (the film was shown in 3-D originally)set this film apart from many westerns made at this time.  It would make a terrfic double feature with Anthony Mann's "The Naked Spur".  This film is a must see for western fans
1	All Great Things Must Come To An End. What can I say, Yu Yu Hakusho was a great, and I mean GREAT,  show.  I loved it
1	five stars just for the stylin of 1971. I wanted to pluck out each and every one of these guys and feed them a sandwich- they were so skinny- How refreshing- and Leon Russell's pale arms with no tatoos- and the long silver hair. Wow. how about all of the chainsmoking on stage- I do believe that Eric Clapton had a cigarette holder on his guitar fret- wow again. How times have changed .Seriously, if you want to buy this concert footage just for the music- that's ok too. There is a ton of stuff to enjoy . Most outstanding is the fact that this do-gooder deed- a benefit concert to aid a humanitarian effort - was totally groundbreaking , and they were all there to have fun and all that.Good stuff
1	HANNAH MONTANA ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I love this show I have seen every episode so many times now when I watch it I say all the lines with them.The bonus episode will most likely be Money for Nothing, Guilt for Free (which I have already seen 6 times, I downloaded it)I can't wait for this to come out I already have the game, and have been to 2 of her concerts, so I am going to be first in line with both the CD and DVD.For thoes who don't already know there will be 3 episodes + the bonus one.This is my favorite show, and if you haven't seen it yet you should watch it, or if you think it won't be good at least give it a chance.~Sophi
1	Hilarious; worth owning for Leary fans. In the tradition of the New York Friars Club Roasts, Comedy Central's Roast of Denis Leary is deservedly the highest rated program to hit the cable network (next to South Park that is) as it shows the foul-mouthed, scathing comic getting a taste of his own medicine from his closest friends.  Hosted by Jeff Garlin of HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm and featuring live remarks from Colin Quinn, Adam Ferrara, Lenny Clark, Nick DiPaulo, Dane Cook, Mario Cantone, Dr. Dre & Ed Lover, Jim Breuer, Gina Gershon (performing a musical and dance number), along with taped comments from Conan O'Brien, Rene Russo, Jon Stewart, Peter Gallagher, Christopher Walken, Michael J. Fox, and Joe Mantagna; the Roast of Denis Leary is full out funny from beginning to end.  It's definitely worth picking up for Leary fans (his rebuttal at the end is scathingly funny), although I wish more special features would have been put on the DVD
1	Just as good as a "Nature" program!. In my opinion, this video is not over-narrated at all.  The videography is amazing and clear, capturing moments the human eye would never see.  The narration is educational and provides wonderful facts about the birds.  This is a real winner with my 7-yr-old, 3-yr-old and the parents
1	"I Hope They Have Icies!". The martial arts comedy "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist" is like a film remix. Two Hong Kong films from the 1970s have been spliced together with new footage, so it now stars director Steve Oedekerk, who also dubs everyone in silly voices (including himself). It's an entertaining, silly film, and I know here in Australia it's already something of a quiet classic among the DVD rental crowd.Steve Oedekerk plays the chosen one, a young man raised by rodents, who has a talking tongue named Tonguey and a dog named Dog, and a young man who seems to attract trouble. The biggest cause of the trouble is a Mr "Betty" Pain, a man whose iron claws, triangular studs and boombox tunes make him virtually invincible. To top it all off, he is a master magician, and can make his associates clothes change colours halfway during a scene. To defeat him, the Chosen One must reach the next level, so he trains and the local dojo. He trains hard, and is an impressive fighter, but will he be able to stop Betty?Dubbing an old film with your own voice seems like such an obvious and funny concept I'm suprised it hasn't been done in a feature film like this before. Steve Oedekerk has a lot of fun playing with the dubs, camera angles, battle scenes and martial art film cliches. The new footage fits in really well. There is a bit of computer animation, but it is given the weathered treament along with the old footage, which is a really good look I think. It's a very, very quotable film. My favorite scene would probably have to be the intermission, where the characters recommend snacks for the viewers to eat from the lobby. "I have Chosen the large tub" says the Chosen One. "My nipples look like Milk Duds" says Wimp Lo. "I hope they have Icies!" the pretty Ling says. One of the martial arts masters makes a comment about yellow popcorn, but I won't repeat that here. That reminds me, the film does get a little crude at times, and a little bloody (in a silly way), but it's not too bad.The "Chosen" Edition is the one to get, as it includes features (like the audio modes) which are just as funny as the film, and give you an idea of how the film(s) was mixed together.I'd recommend this film to people who like to laugh at bad films (though this is a good film). It plays errors and such for laughs, and is goofy enough to be watched again and again
1	"Blacks are NOT dumb"...so the user says. Some critics of this artist believe that they are slick by saying that Tupac makes blacks look "dumb" and goes further to say that "blacks are NOT dumb". First of all, I'm black and we don't need other people to define what is intellectually acceptable for us. Thank you. He was a performer, an artist, a poet. NEWSFLASH! Sometimes in America, performers, artists, and poets are idolized and respected. In my opinion, Americans need to consider the cessation of 2 things: the criticism of the intelligence of artists and their fans(let them choose what they like) AND creating the imaginary scale which defines what a "smart black" and a "dumb black" is. Non-blacks should not perpetuate the idea that "the hip hop artist of the week" is responsible for the rest of the country's opinion of black intelligence. You ARE insulting our intelligence when you say things like that. Most Americans of all races know that Tupac is not the model of black authenticity. Black people don't walk around saying Kurt Cobaine (of Nirvana) was a junky that made white people look like junkies. (If they listened to his music, they might call Kurt a genius.) Keep an open mind, my friend
1	Fabulous and Creepy 70's Sci-fi!. I didn't see this 1975 film until about 12 years ago or so. Even though I knew the basic plot I was quite captivated by the events of the story. Well, I've seen it three more times since then and each time I'm taken in by the storyline, not to mention well entertained.THE PLOT: Katharine Ross and her husband move to Stepford, CT, where many of the wives of the village seem to be oblivious to the current women's liberation movement; they seem wholly dedicated to their husbands, home & garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. Meanwhile Katharine's husband joins a mysterious all-male organization. [Spoiler Alert!] It turns out that the men of this organization are replacing their wives with android duplicates. Katharine's best friend ends up duplicated and Katharine slowly realizes, to her horror, that she's next in line. [End Spoiler].Paula Prentiss and Tina Louise (Ginger from Giligan's Island) are on hand as Katharine's friends.The story is not campy at all. This is serious and creepy sci-fi of the highest order. "The Stepford Wives" powerfully succeeds where the similar-themed "Westworld" only passably gets by.
1	Beautiful. I've heard naysayers badmouth this movie, but I've never understood it.  They use descriptors such as "preachy", "overly dramatic", "self-important", and so on.  Good grief!  What are you, bait fishers (not that there's anything wrong with that)?  This is the story of this man's family, and it is truly beautiful.I guide trout fishing trips in Missouri, so, of course, I love this movie partly for the fishing.  This film explained my fly-fishing passion to my wife more effectively than my words and dragging her along on a few fishing trips ever could.  The scenes are filmed magnificantly and are done in such a way that you can follow the logic and instinct that each fisherman uses to catch each fish.  However, the story is so much more than this.The story begins with Norman making note that there was never a clear line between religion and fly-fishing in his family, and that parallel continues throughout the story and his life.  Success as a fly-fisherman is based on knowledge, physical skill, intuition, and emotion, but balance is also required.  That balance only comes through spirituality, whether you are stiving to be a Godly person, or whether you simply commune with nature in a spiritual fashion.  Without balance, a tangled line can cause you to pull your hair out.  With balance, even the most unsuccessful fishing trip brings joy.  And so Norman stuggles with understanding his younger brother Paul, who has attained such miraculous balance on the river, but whose life away from the river is rapidly spinning out of control.  In the end, the observant viewer should recognize that it is Paul's pride that eventually leads to his downfall, and it is the family's failure at their attempts to rescue Paul that they continue to struggle with the remainder of their lives as well.Norman spends his life trying to tap into God's balance through fly-fishing in the hopes that he will someday understand what happened to his family and why.  Perhaps finally writing his book helped him to answer a few of those questions.Walt Fulpshttp://www.MissouriTroutHunter.co
1	Fun. I truly enjoyed the fact of the DVD being interactive.  It is a hard game to beat.  I like all the different choices one has to make
1	is this for real?. Why in the world is it not out till 2010? or is that wrong
1	This will be absolutely AWESOME!!!!. I have been a Yankees DIE-HARD fan since 1961. This set will be totally spectacular! I own all Yankee DVD's and videos. These extras are mind-boggling. As soon as I finish writing this review I will be ordering this 5-disc set. If you are a Yankee fan this is a must have!
1	Furiously Effective Jab at Wal-Mart's Monopolistic Practices. Filmmaker Robert Greenwald has effectively made mincemeat of his targets in a couple of recent fiery documentaries - Rupert Murdoch and the FOX Network in "Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism", and the Bush administration in "Uncovered: The War on Iraq". His latest is no exception as he lays into Wal-Mart, its CEO Lee Scott and Sam Walton's heirs in this probing 2005 critique of corporate injustice. Instead of providing a single narrative voice, Greenwald structures his film as a series of vignettes focusing on discrete instances of where Wal-Mart has violated fair market practices, passed over women and minorities for leadership positions, restricted movements toward employee unionization, taken advantage of cheap labor in China and India, and disregarded environmental standards.The grievances seem endless, and the film even discloses the embarrassingly paltry amounts each Walton family member has given to charitable causes (compared to Bill Gates, of course). The most touching episodes focus on victims like Red Esry, who are experiencing the closure of their multi-generational small businesses in small towns where Wal-Mart opens and cannibalizes the competition. Much of the treatment seems ham-fisted, especially in the juxtaposition of Wal-Mart commercials and in-house training videos within the context of those being crushed by the corporation's economic clout. Moreover, the one segment about the rape of an employee in a parking lot, while horrific, seems more generic in nature than Wal-Mart's accountability in the incident. The abundance of conjecture and the lack of attributable facts tend to affect some of the film's credibility.However, Greenwald makes his points with clarity. Especially effective is the use of archived footage of Scott asserting to a massive audience of his employees that Wal-Mart has done nothing but good for the economy, even though many of them have to go on welfare to get medical care. The film ends with a montage of people who have successfully lobbied against the construction of stores in their towns. At the same time, Greenwald has not made a monomaniacal diatribe, as the takeaway never feels like the destruction of Wal-Mart but more a call for a severe overhaul of their internal practices. The filmmaker has certainly come a long way since his 1980 feature film debut, the ludicrous "Xanadu", and he seems to be continuing his streak of confronting those corrupted by their power.The DVD has several extras, the best being a twenty-minute making-of featurette and a separate 16-minute short, "The Big Meeting", on how the film came about. Greenwald also provides a commentary track, though much of what he shares can be gleaned from the featurettes. There are a couple of deleted segments that do seem redundant if they were included in the movie (one set in Quebec, the other in England), as well as a brief clip of local religious leaders condemning Wal-Mart's practices. Lastly, there are several fitfully funny Wal-Mart commercial parodies that apparently served as commercials for the documentary. Those looking for a more-in-depth analysis of Wal-Mart's business impact may want to read Charles Fishman's "The Wal-Mart Effect: How the World's Most Powerful Company Really Works - and How It's Transforming the American Economy"
1	Redemptive Power Of Love. This is a surprising relationship between an upwardly mobile, 27-year-old advertising executive and a 43-year-old waitress who works at a hamburger joint. What begins as a drunken seduction moves on to sexual obsession for both parties. Susan Sarandon gives a top drawer performance as Nora, a boozy redneck survivor whose heroine is none other than the self destructive Marilyn Monroe. James Spader is perfectly cast as Max Baron, a compulsively neat and sexually repressed widower who is brought back to the land of the living by Nora's erotic ministrations. Eileen Brennan does wonders with the minor role of Noras' sister, a fortune-teller. Luis Mandoski's direction of White Palace makes it into a convincing psychodrama about the redemptive power of love which can even overcome deep-seated class differences.
1	REQUEST SEASON 4!. Please write an email to disney requesting the release of season 4 of BMW. It was supposed to be released in Jan of 06' then supposedly Feb, but there is still no news of its release. If you want the other seasons of BMW to be released write a quick email to them telling them how much you want it. Here's their email:Disney: disneyinfo@disneyhelp.comThanks
1	Outstanding but Intense. I would rate the acting of the ensemble cast in Six Feet Under as one of the best ever in any TV drama Series I have seen.  The writing and directing are right up there too. However, a note of caution for those considering this set and are new to the show.  It is very intense.It is called "quirky" by many viewers I have spoken to, and that would make sense considering it revolves around a family-owned funeral home and each episode begins with a death.  The show does have a real ability to "pull the viewer into the story line," which is an obvious indicator that it is well written, but because of it's intensity, watching too many episodes at once "got to me," and may well "get to you" also.If you are looking for something light and easy going, this is not the show.  Not to say that there aren't plenty of "laugh-out-loud" scenes - the show has a very unique off-beat humor to it, but overall, the characters go through a lot of difficult "stuff."  I personally got a lot out out of it - for a TV drama, it offers an amazing amount of life-lessons and insight that makes a viewer think.Bottom line:  this is an A+ drama, and I would highly recommend it - but not for someone looking for a light-hearted comedy
1	BRILLIANT. The producers of Martha Stewart Television are brilliant.  The content is amazing.  The direction fantastic.  And the programming content unsurpassed.THIS wedding DVD COLLECTION is worth every penny
1	Chain of Fools - Great Film with one Rare Diamond - Elijah Wood. Chain of Fools? Comedy of Errors? Hard to say, except this extremely entertaining farce with a stellar cast and intelligent script engages the viewer at every turn. No lulls-no dry spots. Unfortunately, there's no heavy themes as well-except a thread that life is worth living and it can be lived without the benefit of three ancient Chinese coins called the Shiny New Enemies. Chain of Fools, released on such a limited basis most people still know nothing of its existence, has grown in popularity since its 2000 release through increased viewership, especially from the fans of some of its stars-particularly Elijah Wood.The comedy is dark, somewhat racy and at times downright bizarre-but in the good sense of that word (??). Lines and moods are juxtaposed to get a laugh. The characters are-well, a chain of fools, from the accidental killer barber, the ne'er-do-well entrepreneur, the centerfold police detective, the teenage hit man-to the drag-queen nurse and her gangster boyfriend, the spelling-challenged mobster and the insane boy scout leader. Mix them all together, you get-mixed nuts and a great deal of true entertainment. Who needs a theme when you have a plot so circuitous and convoluted that you need a score card to ride the roller coaster. Fortunately, as I mentioned, the script is clever and smart. The visual application supports the premise, if there is one; and most important, the cast is sound to superlative.The star, Steve Zahn turns in a strong performance as Kresk the lousy barber-comic, desperate and likeable. He's a lovable loser and we root for him. His antagonist, Salma Hayek, as Detective Kolko, whose claim to fame is her spread in Playboy, provides a solid foil to Steve Zahn's desperate bid to sleep with her. David Cross's Andy, the overgrown Boy Scout leader, bumbles well through his role with several funny moments, particularly when he brings a young scout to an avalanche of tears over tying a square knot.The bad guys are zany and energetic. Tom Wilkinson as the pompous, out of place Bollingsworth exudes humor. His versatility runs the gamut from his zany comments at the heist to his hiring of an unlikely hitman. It's a shame his character is in a coma for the majority of the movie. Jeff Goldblum's gangster, Avnet, is snaky and treacherous. We're glad to see him downed by a pair of accidental scissors to the neck and a Pastrami on Rye in the face. Other good performances (in some case fleeting) are turned in by Kevin Corrigan as Paulie, the local mobster; David Hyde Pierce as the insidious Mr. Kerner; Orlando Jones as an over-the-top drag queen, Miss Cocoa, and Lara Flynn Boyle as Kresk's ex-wife, Karen.Chain of Fools would probably be just another solid Indy comedy if it were not for the phenomenal performance of Elijah Wood as Mikey, the teenage hitman. Wood's intelligence focuses on the unlikely character, casting him against type. But, once again, Elijah Wood inhabits his character to grab every scene its in and turn it into the glue that transforms a B+ film into an A+ one. Elijah Wood projects a steel force character in a handsome, kid's body to the point we forget the kid and believe the villain. Then, he surprises us by resuscitating the kid, so much so, when he disappears from the film, the remaining fifteen minutes is just so much anti-climax. Wood provides the funniest scenes in the film from his assassination of a state politician (we are given three different versions), to his atonal response to suicide. We get hitman wisdom from a toilet seat and a Sartrian discussion of life and death during a hit. Elijah Wood may not be the star of Chain of Fools, but he is the most iconic link in this farcical bracelet.Without a doubt, Chain of Fools is underrated, because it never received a wide-screen release. For Elijah Wood fans, it was made in the shadow of Frodo Baggins and could have very well gone unnoticed like that other gem of gems released (or not released) during the same period, The Bumblebee Flies Anyway. In any case, the quality of a film should never be judged by the quantity of its viewers. If I were the only person to see this work, I would still give it an A+ as one of the smartest, nearly flawless films to commence the 21st Century.
1	Great Concert DVD. Hayley Westerna has a beautiful voice, Fans of artists like Charlotte Church or Sarah Brightman will enjoy this amazing 17 year old from New Zealand.  First of all anyone who can do a great cover of a Kate Bush Song (Wuthering Heights) has got to have talent.  This is a real nice concert.  The performance is wonderful.  The video and audio quality are exceptionally good.  The 5.1 Dolby Surround mix is as good as it gets.  Overall one of the best concert DVDs I've seen recently.
1	My Fascination with This Series Is Almost Embarrassing. Between CSI Miami and this, the original series, I think that this series wins hands down.  I remember first seeing Petersen (Gil Grissom) in Manhunter (the first movie based on Thomas Harris' book the Red Dragon and the perfect movie adaptation of that book) when he was quite a bit younger and thinner but it is not his leading man qualities that make him so appealing.The writers/producers/directors of this series manage to recreate some of the things that make British crime dramas so fascinating-- they 1) don't pull away from the dark to contrive a happy ending; 2)they don't hesitate to portray the lead characters as vulnerable and "strange"; and 3) they look for really great faces, not conventionably pretty or ugly actor, for the parts.Sure, it's science fantasy in the sense that things don't happen  in real life the way they happen in the CSI lab,  and it's not great art, but its a great way to pass time
1	Annie rocks!. Look at my review for the movie soundtrack.  I had a full vinyl copy of the voiced movie, but my mom sold it.  I hate that fact, but there isn't a thing I can do about it.  I wish I could get one back
1	Five stars (with reservations). Medium is a very good adult audience supernatural suspense series. The show is mostly convincing with a stellar performance on the part of Ms. Arquette, and most of the supporting cast is excellent. It is unfortunate that the part of Mr. Dubois (who is supposed to be a rocket scientist) is so unsympathetic, and seems to be a bit slow.  Now I am aware that many gifted mathematicians have a missing element socially, but the real Mr. Dubois in interview, does not seem so. However, in "Sweet Dreams"episode,(ala "It's a Wonderful Life"), Joe is what you would hope he would be for the rest of the series, so go figure. The children of the show are a mixed bag, but talented child actors are few and far between.The crimes that are solved are not family friendly, but the show is about half about the family dynamic of their unique situation. Which makes for pretty good drama, my reservations notwithstanding.  One of the recurring bad guys in the show is an evil spirit that is the source for psychosis in mentally ill criminals. I don't like the inference, but it is an interesting proposal.That being said, this show is fascinating, if you can accept that the real Allison Dubois is truly anything like purported in the show.
1	Catherine the Great PBS. I have both versions of Catherine the Great, A&E in their version was lacking in many areas and I was dismayed that they turned one of the great people of the world into something trival.  The PBS version which with Bruni is exceptional, though with all documentaries and movies time is trunicated and not all history is told PBS does an admirable job and presenting the basic facts.The documentary was a joy to watch and the scholars from Europe comparing her to other great people fits
1	Very good yoga DVD. Hi, I started Kali Ray TriYoga three months ago and I bought that DVD to deepen my practice. I have never practiced Yoga before so I cannot say something about this style in comparison with others. However I love the soft and gentle moves of Kali Ray TriYoga.The DVD starts with rhythmic breathing. The main practices on this DVD include leg strech, reclined butterfly, cat rolls, cat bow I, mountain heel press, cat bow 2 flow, runner, triangle, side warrior, and half tortoise twist.Kali Ray has a very gentle voice and explains the flow very nicely. If you have practiced Yoga before you should have no problems to follow her without looking on the screen. Beginners may have to watch the DVD first and then try the movements. However, no DVD will ever replace a yoga teacher who can correct you and help to improve your practices.For me it is a very good way to practice until my next yoga class starts again in a couple of weeks :)
1	The Troubles. 'Omagh' is the heart-wrenching true story of the 1998 terrorist bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland and it's aftermath. The simple but well-crafted film follows a man named Michael Gallagher and his family after his son Aidan is killed in the blast which took the lives of 29 civilians. The bombing was carried out by "The Real IRA," an offshoot of the original IRA who did not support the peace process agreed to by the latter. There is very little historical context, so anyone looking to learn the background of "The Troubles" will not find it here. Instead, it is a moving story about the real effects of terrorism on innocent people caught in the middle of political warfare. The film maintains a very somber tone throughout, and I agree with the other reviewers about the lack of sentimentality. There is little action or suspense, and one could hardly describe the film as exciting. The film is more of an experience rather than "entertainment." The only shot of the picturesque Irish landscape is in the opening scene, where the bombers are shown driving through the breath-taking, yet dreary Irish countryside. The most moving part of the film is the immediate aftermath of the bombing, where Gallagher desperately searches for his missing son, only to have his worst fear confirmed. This leads Gallagher to form a support group for the victim's families and embark on a mission to bring the killers to justice. This is far from a heart-warming film, and it leaves the viewer with an empty feeling, along with a sense that true justice will always take a backseat to politics and abstractions.
1	Essential Hitchcock, But Not His Best. An early Hitchcock work, 'Foreign Correspondent' is one of Turner Classic Movies' "Essentials". Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea), a crime beat reporter is dispatched to Europe in August 1939 to 'get the facts' on what is really going on over there. What he finds is an outfit called the Universal Peace Party led by Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), a secret clause in an international treaty, and a kidnapped diplomat. Jones tracks down a nest of traitors and falls in love with Fisher's daughter Carol (Laraine Day) along the way.In a classic scene, an escaping assassin's trail is revealed by an overhead shot of movement amongst tightly packed umbrellas.Others have wondered why this Hitchcock film is not ranked with say a film like 'North by Northwest'. The simple reason is that it's just not as good as his later movies. Take, the instant cornball romance for example - the cornball I can take, but they fall in love in about 12 seconds. Or the silly notion of a meaningful secret clause in a treaty between the Dutch and the Belgians.Of some interest is the movie's open appeal by Hitchcock for America to get in to the war, complete with patriotic music (Star Spangled Banner) at the conclusion. Trivia: Gary Cooper turned down the lead role that went to McCrea and later termed it his biggest mistake.Recommended
1	The Spirit of the WARRIOR!. This is a must-have DVD, not only for wrasslin' fans, but for all of mankind. You will learn the ways of the WARRIOR and hopefully learn something about yourself as well.
1	Everyone Loves To Get Hustled. I had heard this Brit TV show was very popular over the pond, and watched a few episodes on A and E, and was immediately hooked.  The acting, the story lines, the "catch you sleeping" at the end makes this show refreshing and fun to watch.  It seems on USA crime-con-action shows you see a recycled actor(s) from a cancelled show and it is hard to make their characters credible.  Robert Vaughn, formerly the Man From U.N.C.L.E. is the cherry on top of the sundae as well.  Solid show and looking forward to Season Two on disc and hopefully season three real soon.  You cannot go wrong with this DVD colection to anyone's library.
1	Odd Couple. It's hard to understand why Amazon would suggest that buyers of the Ann Coulter documentary would also enjoy 'Michael & Me' by Michael Moore!!! A reality check is needed for whoever made this recommendation!
1	Walking the Bible. This DVD was excellent and I have shared it with others in my Bible Study that I teach.  Everyone loved it
1	Maximus Movimus. Russell Crowe and this picture deserved their Oscars for this terrific movie. I wish they could make another. This was undoubtedly Ridley Scott's best turn as a Director since Alien. He also deserved the Oscar.A rare movie gets a great story which includes not only action but love and presents both to good effect. The set offers many great insights to those of us who need to know how things work. So buy it if you need to know, I did and was not disapointed other than to want even more! Again I say a 5 Star Bravo for this movie and an additional Star for all the variations and extras it contains
1	here's the list. hey amazon: please list the CD tracks and DVD songs so we know what we're getting!  Here's the songs (I got from www.alanjackson.com) on AJ Greatest Hits Disk 2:1. Remember When2. Who's Cheatin' Who3. Little Man4. Pop A Top5. www.memory6. Driv
1	A generic but entertaining adventure. "El-Hazard: The Magnificent World" is an anime very much in the "Tenchi Muyo!" mold: a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist Makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women. Though the characters in "El-Hazard" aren't developed as deeply as the "Tenchi" crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing, "El-Hazard" has a charm all it own. The mysterious antiheroine Ifurita is compelling, and the kids' hard-drinking teacher Fujisawa is consistently funny. Most impressively, "El-Hazard" tells a complete and satisfying story, tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist. Usually these types of shows start strong, only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings. Even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved!The dub is also pretty darn good, though it tends to get overly shouty, especially in the segments centering on Jinnai. Can't the guy ever just speak in a normal tone?"El-Hazard" is hardly the type of show that will change your life, but if you like "Tenchi" or other anime in this vein, this box set is probably a good bet. (The set actually contains two separate shows: the original "El-Hazard" OAV and its 4-episode sequel "El-Hazard 2." The sequel is an inconsequential side story that unfortunately doesn't really add any value.)
1	One of the best. I read a few reviews about this movie.  Many disparage the movie.  So be it.  Live and let live I always say.First of all, I bought the DVD version here at Amazon dot com.Amazon shipped quickly and accurately;  thanx Amazon , you are the reason that I don't have to go to a myriad of book/video/DVD/CD stores to find in item that I am ISO.I guess I am one of those "sci fi" "cult movie" "fans".I'm very happy that a DVD version of this movie was made.  I thank Amazon dot com for having it available for purchase.I gave it 5 stars; cuz, "they just don't make 'em like the used to". Nowadays, "B" sci-fi flicks are just so bogus.  Buy this movie if only to see what making a film was like before the advent of C..artoon G...enerated I...mages, or...CGI.  It is a gas.Sean Connery did several low budget sci-fi flicks and I hold that by doing so, he showed his "range" of acting skills.  I personally view  him as one damn fine "jouneyman" actor.  Give the man a script, and he delivers no matter what.  A must have for Sean Connery fans everywhere.Last word_________Fantabulous flick
1	I could watch BEST IN SHOW 24 hours a day for the rest of my life. Set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog, BEST IN SHOW is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud.Though there is a scripted premise, most of the dialog in BEST IN SHOW is ad-libbed by comedic greats that include Christopher Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Ed Begley, Jr. to name just a few.The gist of BEST IN SHOW is simple: five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other, travel to Philadelphia to enter the Mayflower, a prestigious championship dog show, loosely based on the Westminster event.Beatrice, the emotionless Weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey) who are nervous wrecks, read the J. Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru.Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch).Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills.Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins).Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of.There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount.  Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr.Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners.But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, "they all jump."BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman.  With star performances by some of the most talented comedians of our time, this movie will have you laughing out loud from start to finish
1	Soothing. Very spiritually uplifting.  Takes patience to a whole new level.  For those seeking spirituality, it bring to the forthfront what faith is all about
1	Well worth your time. Early Hackman, REALLY early Melanie Griffith.  Cohesive, provocative script that will stand you in good stead for repeated viewing.  Interesting photography, particularly the underwater shots.  With Hackman one expects excellent acting and you will not be disappointed in any of the cast.  The nude scenes are beautifully done, not blatant and fall naturally into the storyline.Good, solid, well-done film.  The director is to be complimented
1	Watch It Even If You Never Watched It On TV!. I never watched the Apprentice when it was on TV.  I thought I wouldn't like it because I am not into business or Donald Trump.  But I ended-up checking it out from my library just to see what the big stink was about, and I was HOOKED!  I watched it all weekend, one episode after the other.  I had to know what happened!  I loved the challenges given to the contestants - it was fun to see how they would work through them.  Plus there is plenty of personal conflict and drama.  GREAT show
1	Memories Are Made Of This!. What do the following have in common?A boy named Ralphie and the phrase 'You'll poke your eye out'!A Red Ryder BB Gun and a sexy, black-mesh leg that's a lamp.A bar soap wielding mother and an expletive shouting father.A pepto-bismol pink Easter bunny suit and a boy who eats like a piggy.You're right! They all add up to A Christmas Story!It is about Ralphie, wonderfully played by Peter Billingsley, who longs for a Red Ryder BB Gun!He repeatedly hears 'You'll poke your eye out' every time he mentions the gun.Darrin McGavin is terrific as the contest entering father who is ecstatic when he finally wins.His prize, a leg-shaped animated lamp complete with a black mesh stocking!In his eyes the leg of lamp (I coudn't resist) is absolutely beautiful and,much to the dismay of his wife, he proudly displays it for all to see in their front window.The lamp is a major source of contention between them as each one attempts to move it!His language when anything goes wrong - from the exploding furnace to the sparking wiringto the neighbors free roaming dogs has reprecussions when, in frustration, Ralphie repeats them.Enter Mom with the soap! Don't worry you won't hear the actual words being said but you will getthe gist or should that be drift as this is a winter story!Little brother, Randy, is a picky eater and is only successfully coaxed to eat by his mother, played perfectlyby Melinda Dillon, when she has him pretend to eat like his favorite storybook animal, a pig!With his face firmly in the plate he eats like one much to the disgust of his father!Although based on the Red Ryder BB gun, there are many other storylines highlighted in this wonderful movie.There are bullies, school friends, Christmas tree lots, Santa coming to town and the hilarious Christmas giftof a  pink Easter Bunny outfit poor Ralphie has to try on! You will enjoy this movie!It takes place at a time when I was growing up and many of the scenes recall my childhood.To those of us who grew up in the forties and early fifties it brings back fond memories of our past Christmases.We had real trees adorned with tinsel and glowing with big colorful bulbs, no themed trees with just whitelights, our trees glowed with a rainbow of colors. We had favorite radio shows, wore galoshes and hadbackyards with snow covered sheds just like the ones in Ralphie's backyard.All of those are in this film, and as such, A Christmas Story has a wonderful familiarity about it.You can almost smell the heavy scent of pine mixed with the delicious aroma of a roasting turkey.This movie is a classic and will, once again, be eagerly watched by our family.Ah! Memories are made of this!
1	Another Peter Sellers Gem. Sellers is appropriately low-key and gentle in his role of a latter-day (sixties Britain)cleric whose attempts to emulate the work of Christ are either thwarted by the rich (the aristocrats and church hierarchy)or misunderstood by it's intended beneficiaries (i.e. the welfare family who he's given shelter who are looting the church).  Ultimately this movie is both hilarious satire but somewhat tragic.  No fear, though, Sellers reverend gets the last laugh
1	Suicide Girls - The First Tour. The DVD arrived in a timely matter and the DVD was a gift for a friend who enjoyed watching it
1	Highly recommended by all our reviewers. We would just like to agree with the other reviews & say this is an excellent series. This is without doubt the finest collection of Miami Salsa dance moves available.This 3 dvd set is well worth adding to your collection or if you are an absolute beginner then this is the series for you.Highly recommended by all our reviewers (30+ Salsa teachers)
1	Better than the first. Awesome movie. 5 stars. Cant wait for the next one.. One of my favorite movies.
1	Exhausting. Robin Williams is an AFRS disc jockey in Saigon during the Vietnam War. He is fast-talking, zany, unconventional - and a problem for his superiors. Williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone, doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can, that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten. The movie is an exhausting experience to watch, as it must have been for Williams to perform. It's an amazing one-man show, but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty
1	Maximum WASSage... True, it shouldn't be compared to the other entries. I know its difficult considering the name. I thought Ted Wass would become a comic superstar. He is quite funny in this as well as "Oh God! You Devil." This is like many other comedies...not for all tastes. A nice widescreen transfer and a rare trailer are plus. Not the worst entry in the series. Worth the money for fans
1	A classic!. We all love a good B-movie, and "Q" tops my list of guilty pleasures. It is, simply put, a good old-fashioned B-movie romp, with all of the requisite ingredients- a fabulous monster, a scenery-chewing cop, an oblivious public, and an anti-hero (you can't decide if you love Michael Moriarty or hate him). I would definitely recommend "Q" for viewing on a laid-back Saturday evening with a bowl of popcorn.
1	Amazing. This movie was moving, and as always, Johnny Depp's performance was flawless.I got this movie on a whim because I love fairy tales and older Disney movies, and I love hearing history of where certain things came from.  So I had heard this story but the way I heard it, he was having the affair.  I love the way this movie was done, the intimacy and the tenderness and the closeness of Johnny Depp's character to the little boys was touching.I recommend this movie for a couple to watch, because watching it alone will make you feel lonely.
1	EXCELLENT, MUST HAVE VIDEOS FOR ALL KIDS. I bought the Talking Words Factory on a whim and it ended up being the best video I have ever purchased.  My daughter started watching it at 3 and after only viewing it about five times, she knew ALL of her letter sounds.  She already knew her letters, but I was amazed at how fast she picked up the sounds.  She is now 4 1/2 and her PK teacher told us she is at the top of the class for phonics knowledge.  When I told her why, she wrote all the information down to pass onto other parents whose children are struggling.Now, my 2-year old watches them and she only knows a few letters, but she knows almost ALL of her sounds when you ask her.  That is impressive!  After seeing the success with my kids, I bought them for my nieces, one of which was struggling with severe ADHD and classroom difficulty.  She mastered sound and blending concepts that she could not master in the classroom and she now has a great phonetic background.  I know she would not be where she is today if she didn't have these videos.  I am a Speech-Language Pathologist and I highly recommend them to ALL my parents at school.  I have also donated the Letter Factory to all of my kindergarten and PK classrooms.  I know they will enjoy them as much as my kids did (and still do!).
1	Solid dark comedy and strong metaphor. This is an underrated and little-seen film.  If you enjoy thoughtful dark comedies, this is the one for you.  Willem Dafoe's expressions and movements, John Malkovich's delivery....They are worth the price in and of themselves.  It's also a metaphor for filmmaking, sacrifice, how far some people would go for their art, and more.  Beautifully photographed in Luxembourg, with lighting and shadow as a work of art
1	Outsatnding Film: Despair And Rebirth!. This is one of the greatest films to come out of the UK in the past 20 years. That's saying quite a bit, considering the number of high calibre films the UK has come out with in the past 20 years. There are numerous great reviews here on amazon, therefore, I will be brief. I titled this as "Despair and Rebirth" What I mean by this is that the character Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) finally comes to terms with his self-destructive nature as a heroin addict; and awakens to a new and better tomorrow, and therefore gets a new lease on life: A much better life. Moreover, it is a new life that many of his friends never get in the film. And the way the film depicts his life as a junkie, along with his friends, is nothing but depair. You can't help feeling empathy for Mark Renton, and you root for him to succeed in overcoming his terrible addiction.This film is great because it does not gloss over the terrible and destructive nature of drug addiction: And heroin in particular. This film does not glorify drugs as one of the reviewers wrote, on the contrary, it gives the viewer the ugly truth about a life of addiction: Especially with the graphic scenes of how horrible the life of a junkie really is. With the opening scenes dialogue of Mark Renton sarcastically mocking society as not the life he chooses to live, to the end of the film's dialogue of his wanting to become part of society; the viewer can understand his reasons: Because in between these two dialogues, which serve as book-ends, the viewer witnesses the despair and horrible life that he lives. And the comfort is in seeing that he has decided to take an alternate course: A life without herion. The entire film is great and highly recommended. [Stars: 5+
1	Horror In The Sky. I remember seeing this film when I was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless.  Seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling.  I didn't know what the name of this movie was and I was looking for it in the video stores.  I stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that I saw 20 years ago, I bought it. After seeing it again, this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago.  Though, by today's standards, this movie is rather cheap and cheesy, it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling.  This movie is original, having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings, that eats people like birds eat worms.  This movie is a hybrid of Godzilla and slasher flicks.  This is definately B-movie material, but it's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories... and that is worth more than the price of admission
1	It's a pretty good anime, but it's great if you're a fan. I remember playing loads of Street Fighter II when it came out when me and my cousin would go head-to-head often or we would try to do the single player. After the incredibly lame live-action movie came out, the series actually gained a better respectability through its anime shows/movies. One such movie was the Street Fighter II animated movie which features some pretty cool fight scenes, a fan-favorite(well if you're into that anyways) shower scene and some spot-on characterization. If only it had a bit more story development and didn't have characters making glorified cameos.While in battle, Ryu displays some massive fighting capabilities which attracts the attention of General Bison, ruler of the Shadoloo syndicate. He's been researching the best fighters in the world and even putting some under control to do his bidding. So it's up to Ryu, his friend/rival Ken, detective and all-around cutie Chun-Li and soldier Guile to take down Bison.Like Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter II was a huge fan-favorite game when they first came out so it's of course obvious a film will be made. And this case, there is a story but it's not really the greatest. Characters drop out at times completely while others just merely get a cameo. Cammy is literally in 2 scenes, T-Hawk and Dee-Jay is in 1 and Fei Long is in one admittedly cool battle but that's it. The ones I mentioned before mainly get top billing alongside Vega, Balrog and E.Honda. It's really disappointing since it would've been nice to see more screen-time instead of the massive amount of time on Ryu and Ken(more Cammy for instance) but that's alright.How are the fight scenes? Well, if you're a fan of Street Fighter you'll love them since not only are they quite fast(and even brutal at times) they're filled with moves directly from the game such as Chun-Li's hyper kick, E.Honda's slapping, Zangief's piledriver, as well as the infamous "Haduken". Chun-Li's fight with Vega is a definate highlight since it's fast and it gets incredibly vicious at times. Not to mention it happens right after Chun-Li's shower scene which goes to show you the power of animation in getting you riled up over pencil drawings.Is it a good Street Fighter movie? Of course but this isn't a top-tier anime title like Grave of the Fireflies or Akira but it's enjoyable nonetheless and for a movie based on a fighting game, that's pretty surprising.
1	I wish I was in Dixie... This is one of the best movie about the civil war I've ever seen. It is the most instructive, realistic, with very good actors playing in it ! For once, just like in "Gods and Generals", the movie is more focused on the southern side, which is not very often the case.I am a fan of this part of the U.S. history, and especially of the South, and I was really captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end
1	Kurosawa's Swashbuckling Film. Of all the directing masters Akira Kurosawa is arguably the greatest. No matter how much praise and hyperbole is shoveled onto his films they always surprise me by how good they are. Not good in a, "this was phenomenal for the 1950's," but good as in, "this is better than just about anything we're seeing today." While watching this movie I was trying to think of an American director who even comes close, but no one quite matches Kurosawa. If Akira Kurosawa and Stanley Kubrick had a street fight in Heaven I gurantee you Kurosawa would kick Kubrick in the nuts and decapitate him inside of a minute.This film is often described as the impetus for Star Wars. After seeing the prequel trilogy I half expected The Hidden Fortress to be an exact blueprint for Episode IV, but they're really not that similar. It turns out that George Lucas was talented back in the day. If you're looking for simularities you'll find them, but if Lucas himself hadn't mentioned how much this film influenced him I doubt anyone would be drawing parallels. For example, the two peasant characters, Tahei and Matakishi, are supposed to be the inpirations for R2-D2 and C-3PO, but they're not similar in the least. Tahei and Matakishi are slow, bumbling, greedy, and selfish. They're a far cry from Lucas' creations. R2-D2 is the butch in the relationship while C-3PO is his more feminine partner. (I have to give Lucas credit for having the guts to put a gay robot couple in a film way back in the 70's, and it's even more amazing because no one has had the guts to do it a second time. Perhaps one day gay robots will get the screen time they deserve.)The story involves a princess and her general who are trapped behind enemy lines and must make it back to their own land. Of all the Kurosawa films I've seen this is the most commercial, and should satisfy fans of old action and adventure. Of particular interest is Toshiro Mifune who is a Kurosawa regular. He plays General Rokurota - an all around badass. When his party gets stopped by soldiers trying to hunt them down he quickly kills a couple of them, and then grabs a horse to go hunt down the two trying to escape, all the while letting out a warrior's cry. This action sequence ends in a duel between Rokurota and an opposing general he has a competitive but friendly relationship with. The duel is one of the greatest fight scenes in cinema, and not just because of the fine choreography (although that too), but because of how interesting these two characters are. They respect each other, but if they met on a battlefield then duty would prevail.This is much more of an action adventure film than something like Roshomon, but Kurosawa still manages to throw in a lot of themes. The princess has a slight epiphony while walking among the peasants, and decides to save a girl before she becomes a sex slave; Tahei and Matakishi are both morally bankrupt but they still seem to serve a purpose in society; and General Rokurota and his rival both seem to say something about the merits and limits of honor. These themes are great and add some depth, but are subservient to sheer adventure of the film, which is how it should be.This is a great swashbuckling film that is hands down better than any action film made in the last twenty years.  Some have come close, but I think most will agree that nothing beats The Hidden Fortress.  It is absolutely incredible that with all of the technical achievements over the years Kurosawa's action-adventure piece still holds up so well over the years.  Incredible
1	Volume Four Starts Strong, But Ends Weakly. This is the fourth set of DVDs that complete the WrestleMania Anthology.  Sadly, the last two WrestleManias (19 and 20) aren't that great.  However, this set includes some awesome matches from "WrestleMania 2000" (Edge/Christian vs. The Hardyz vs. The Dudleyz in a Ladder match, or Mick Foley vs. Big Show vs. The Rock vs. Triple H in a No DQ Elimination match for the WWF Championship)."WrestleMania X-8" from 2002 is also a solid PPV.  Hollywood Hulk Hogan has one of his best matches as he faces The Rock, and The Undertaker battles Ric Flair in a No DQ match.  Also, see Triple H in a rare turn as a good guy as he wrestles the first-ever Undisputed WWF champion Chris Jericho.But the real treat on this compilation is "WrestleMania X-Seven" from 2001.  This is the best WrestleMania ever released!  Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon in a Street Fight...TLC II...Stone Cold vs. The Rock (Match 2)...Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle...and the best match of the night - Triple H vs. The Undertaker!  This PPV is superb!Unfortunately, the last two events aren't that great.  "WrestleMania XIX" is forgiveable, because it has two stellar matches (Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels, and Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle).  But "WrestleMania XX" is merely okay because while it has some good ones (Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H---Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle), it has some stinkers too (Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg), and also has three matches that WWE didn't even want to put on the VHS tape (Tag Team Titles matches?).The scratch logos are partially blurred in the first three PPVs, but no audio dubbing seems to have occurred.  My suggestion is that you simply purchase 16 (er, "2000") and 17 individually.  The 18th WrestleMania wouldn't be too bad of an investment either.  However, if you're a completists like me, you'll want to buy all six of them in this pack.  Even though I've written harshly about 19 and 20, they aren't bad.  They just simply could've been so much more and make some questionable decisions.Enough talk, go ahead and buy this.  "WrestleMania" does not survive through nostalgia.  This Anthology is well worth your time
1	GREAT  GREAT Soccer Movie. a movie that is not un-realitisc in the world of soccer.  good acting and very good story line
1	Pretty Darn Good. I admit it, I was surprised at how good this movie was. This was my first bollywood movie ever, I have yet to see even Bride & Prejudice. It wasn't nearly as over the top as people told me it would be. I enjoyed Raj's antics, even though his incredible, pathetic, story about how he needed that last seat on the plane because his son Babloo was sick from a heart attack had me rolling my eyes with a groan. I was outright laughing in the school scene when Raj lived up to Adi's boasting and jumped from the roof of the school and then had to kick a soccer ball back up onto the roof. It's a good thing for Namrata that Raj really did love her, because she was so stupid sometimes and stubborn that many a man would have walked away. All in all, even though this movie was surprisingly long, at 2 hours and 46 minutes, It's well worth the time to watch it
1	fun and cute. The morning I stumbled on this movie, I was intrigued by the title. I actually watched the whole movie and then watched again. I have read with the reviews before posting my own.The morning after i watched it, I got my partner and she and I watched it. True, it did not provide the blood and guts, but it was not intended too.  This movie would be appreciated by bands that are just starting out to make it big.Yes it was surprising that it was made in Africa.  But the best scenes in the movie were near the end.  The surprise in the band was cool and most definate, the selling of the land.We thought it was a great movie and away from the Friday the 13th predicative scenes.Awesome movie.  Yes, we would buy the movie.  The music in the beginning could fit the title and be a little more heavy, but thats cool!!
1	Yes, it's safe. So safe you wouldn't believe... Released in 1976 based on William Goldman's bestseller of the same name, 'Marathon Man' was a greatly anticipated film and it worked brillantly on screen. Goldman seemed to take two elements that spook people, Nazi's and dentists, so fused them into one character, Dr. Szell. Dr. Szell played to the hilt by Laurence Oliver (who was ill at the time and was considered uninsurable) has come out of hiding in Uraguay to collect his war booty and crosses paths with Dustin Hoffman, a graduate student who's drawn into the situation by his brother who works for a shadow element of the government. It's a complicated story, as you would hope for in a thriller. A world class cast of actors, skillfully directed by John Schlesinger, makes for a great film one that can be viewed repeatedly, I saw it when it opened at the Loews in Times Square in 76 and I still can watch it...but must confess, I still close my eyes when Dr. Szell is torturing the Marathon Man. Ouchh! Goldman was so right, a Nazi dentist nothing could be more fiendish
1	This is a classic.... I bought this DVD through Taiseng awhile back for almost $30.00. And, in a way it was definely worth it. Although, nowadays you can get this movie for a few dollars. I recommend this movie if you are into the whole asian cinema, Hong Kong, and samurai movies.The story is good. The sword play is awesome. And, there is plenty of blood that gushes out when the characters die!!! This movie is a blend of a solid samurai movie and a good chinese fantasy/Sword play/ kung-fu movie.I suggest that you rent this if you are not a fan of asian cinema, but if you are I highly recommend this movie. Oh, I think some of you who  listen to rap will recognize the music from this movie. The Rza from the Wu-Tang Clan probably sampled a few loops from this movie
1	Excellent, fun work-out!. If you liked Crunch Cadio-Dance Blast with Marie Forleo, you'll like this onewith Jennifer Galardi.  All the same good qualities are here.  I was happy tofinally find this so I can get to know it and alternate it with Forleo's and acouple of others
1	"Ninotchka, it's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half.". *** This comment may contain spoilers ***"Those were the days, my friends" back in 1939 when Hollywood made the comedies that were funny, classy, and sparkling. Ernst Lubitsch directed the screen legend, the dramatic star Greta Garbo in her first and the best remembered comedy, "NINOTCHKA". In the title role Garbo plays a Soviet envoy sent to Paris to check up on the lack of progress in a sale of the jewels that used to belong to the Grand Duchess Swana, the relative of the last Russian Tsar who now lives in exile in Paris. Initially a fanatical "Bolshevik" and the Ice Queen who never smiles, as the movie progresses, Comrade Ninotchka falls in love with Swana's good friend, playboy Leon d'Algout ( Melvyn Douglas) who tries to interfere with a sale. The first half of the film is among the funniest I've seen. The dialogs and remarks by Billy Wilder are simply sparkling:Ninotchka: We don't have men like you in my country.Leon: Thank you.Ninotchka: That is why I believe in the future of my country.Count Leon D'Algout: Do you like me just a little bit?Ninotchka: Your general appearance is not distasteful.Ninotchka: Don't make an issue of my womanhood.Ninotchka: The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.When Ninotchka began to thaw, it became a little silly for my taste but the Moscow episodes (the omelet-dinner scene at Ninotchka's overcrowded apartment and her conversation with Bela Lugosi's Commissar Razinin) and the end were perfect again. Overall, if anyone had to make a funny and classy comedy making fun of the Russian Politics and fanatic "Bolsheviks", Lubitch, Wilder, and Garbo were the perfect artists for the task.4.5/5 or 9/10
1	GREAT blast from the past!!. I was absolutely addicted to this movie when I was a kid. I watched it over and over (several times a day, back to back). I wore out my VHS long ago, and I am thrilled that it is out on DVD.
1	Brilliant study of courage and redemption in the Nazi era. Remember that saying, "What if they gave a war and nobody came?"  It was around in popular culture back in the late '60s and early '70s when John Lennon was perhaps the best-known antiwar activist and the Vietnam conflict was looking increasingly like a lost cause at least among thinking people.  My best friend and I went to the local draft board and succeeded in being recognized as conscientious objectors.  Could I have done that without him?  I don't know.  Could we have done it if it was not somewhat fashionable?  Probably not.I was reminded of that while watching this beautiful film.  How difficult would it have been to resist the Nazis as a young boy in 1942, when this film is set?  The protagonist, Friedrich, is a working class kid who now has his big chance to enter the elite of the Third Reich as a star boxer while attending an elite academy.  He's handsome, Aryan-looking, and athletic, but early in the film he shows another side.  That side is developed when he meets Albrecht, a slight, somewhat effeminate boy who is the son of a top Nazi official.I read some other review where this film has been marketed as a "gay" movie. That's ridiculous.  Albrecht is not depicted as being gay; he is depicted as being smart and caring.  His stature and appearance simply serve to explain in part the contempt his father has for him as being weak.  He is a little weak in some ways, and that is part of why Friedrich protects him, or tries to.  But this film, like the best anti-Nazi movies, accurately shows who the really weak were--those who went along to get along or to get ahead.There are a number of films in this genre that I like, including "Europa, Europa", "Au Revoir Les Enfants", and one that really needs to be re-issued on DVD (and I am not sure if it was ever on VHS) called "Blood and Honor".   But this one is easily in that class.This film should be required viewing in high school classrooms. Some of us grew up with such weak anti-Nazi movies as "The Sound of Music", where the kinds of moral conflicts treated here were trivialized.  We don't see the death camps in this movie, but that is part of its power.  Albrecht sees just a glimpse of what he is in to and what his father is part of and there are several scenes showing that.This is a fairly long film at 110 minutes.  If I were asked how it could be improved, I might suggest adding more.  There is not a dull moment.  A terrific film that you should not miss.
1	The Lost Battalion - better than average war story. Schroder makes a believable leader in this story. Much of the action sequence is done in the same style as "Saving Private Ryan", if you liked that, you'll like this.Better than average story of the squad who makes their objective, and then is left for loss by their commander.The story and action captures your interest, and you develop a respect for friend and foe alike.
1	MTM fourth season. Timeless humor. Funniest episode was the one in which Sue Ann woos Lars away from Phyllis. Awesome
1	"Anyone?, Anyone?, Bueller?". Matthew Broderick stars in this very funny film about a high school student who decides to take a day off of school.  What happens next can only be described as remarkable and somewhat crazy.Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller, a somewhat clever and deceitful (in a funny way) high school senior who, along with his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) decide to skip school and visit the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago in springtime.  Ferris convinces Cameron to take his father's prized red Ferrari out for the day.  Reluctantly, Cameron agrees, and soon the two are off on their adventure.  Their next plan is to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school so she can go along.  Ferris and Cameron devise a plan to call the school and tell Dean of Students Ed Rooney (Jeffery Jones) that Sloane's grandmother passed away.  Dressed in a long trenchcoat and hat, Ferris arrives at the school to pick up Sloane, and the three drive happily away.  However, Mr. Rooney suspects that something is up and immediately suspects that Ferris is at the root of it.  He sets off to find Ferris himself and bring him back to school.  By the end of the movie, Mr. Rooney probably wishes he had stayed in his office.Meanwhile, Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) has figured out what Ferris is really doing.  Angry that Ferris seems to get away with everything, she has to deal with the entire school taking up a collection for poor, sick Ferris while she really knows what is going on.  In the end, though, she proves to be a big help to him.After heading downtown, the trio take the Ferrari to a local parking garage.  Cameron's father knows the exact mileage of the car, so Cameron is already nervous about allowing Ferris to drive it.  But that's just the beginning.  The garage attendant decides to take the car out for a joyride and racks up over 180 more miles on the odometer.During their day,Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane manage to see the Sears Tower, a Cubs game, visit the Art Institute, and see Ferris sing "Twist and Shout" from a parade float.  But when they head back to the garage to get the car, Ferris finds out about the extra mileage, and Cameron goes crazy.  Ferris seems to think that by driving backwards that the miles will come off, so they jack the car up in the garage and put it in reverse.  However, the miles don't come off.  Cameron, having suffered through a tumultuous relationship with both of his parents, takes out his aggression on the car.  Soon, it goes careening out of the back of the garage and lands in a pile of trees.  Cameron actually feels relieved because now his father will actually have to talk to him.  But Ferris realizes that he has only 5 minutes to get home before his parents do.  Will he make it in time?This movie has attained a sort of "cult" status over the years and still remains as funny as ever.  Matthew Broderick is perfect as the scheming Ferris, while Jeffery Jones does a very good job as Mr. Rooney.  Jennifer Grey plays the part of the overlooked and jealous sister perfectly, and Alan Ruck's job as the reluctant and somewhat confused Cameron is the perfect companion to the wild and reckless Ferris.  Let's not forget the funny cameo by Ben Stein as the teacher who coined the term "anyone, anyone, Bueller?"I recommend this extremely funny movie very highly.  The acting is great and the story is very funny.  As a Cubs fan, I was glad to see the scenes in Wrigley Field and hear Harry Caray's voice.  Watch this great movie and see how much trouble and mischief three friends can get into in one day
1	A classic Movie. Charlton Heston does it again...a great movie for all to watch and learn much about history
1	A Fine Tune  Indeed !!. A great opportunity to see two of the worlds finest Actors toe to toe in this gritty drama about the Army in post war (1945) Britain. Mill's portrayal of Stiff Upper Lip Barrow and Guinness's 'Jock Sinclair' is a masterpiece. The resentment of the two officers to each other grows until the climax of the film.SPOILER BELOWThe most saddest moment is Guinness at the end supported by some his his fellow officers after breaking down following his animated version of the Funeral procession that will take place.
1	PVD = Divine Inspiration. I have the honour to attend in Boston a Paul Van Dyk concert and I must say that its mantra-techno is divine...sounds and good vibrations can be felt through a cd of course...but this DVD-CD Combo is the best deal you can get in a market where some "artists" love to feed you with musical and visual garbage too. PVD's "Global" are nothing else that pure sounds and visual images that will confirm you that you made the right decision...so listen, dance, and enjoy the visual and inner journey:)))
1	It ain't no shoot-um-up western... It's a little draggy but I liked the actors. Good actors can make a good movie great. I liked this movie and saw it when it first came out and have always wanted to own it. Jack and his buddies are horse thieves while Marlon is the 'regulator' hired to catch them. Marlon is an expert marksman and a little ecsentric while Jack is a down to earth horse thieving country boy. It's not your typical  shoot-um-up bar brawling western. It has a nice plot and a surprising ending..
1	Terrific Collection of Duke's 'Late' Westerns!. While a Western 'purist' would certainly prefer seeing a 'dream' boxed set of John Ford/John Wayne's 'Cavalry' trilogy, "Stagecoach", and "The Searchers" released together, the "John Wayne DVD Gift Set" is an excellent collection of some of the Duke's finest westerns from his last two decades.The classic of the collection is "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance", John Ford's 1962 'deconstruction' of the genre he'd helped to create. A visually simple, yet deeply layered tale of how a western legend was born, the film echoes Ford's "The Last Hurrah", as well as taking a tongue-in-cheek 'jab' at critics of his more idealized earlier westerns. While Jimmy Stewart, at 55, is far too old to play an idealistic young lawyer, his confrontations with desperado Lee Marvin, and pragmatic (yet ultimately doomed romantic) Wayne are terrific. And don't miss Edmund O'Brien's 'takeoff' on actor Thomas Mitchell, in support...Ford's directorial 'style' was never better than in this remarkable film."The Sons of Katie Elder" is an important film in Wayne's career, as it marked his 'comeback' after losing a lung to cancer. While much of his dialogue had to be 'looped', and oxygen was kept nearby throughout the filming, Wayne proved that he could still play an action hero believably. Certainly, he looked all of his 58 years, and the idea of Dean Martin being one of his brothers is farfetched, but when Wayne first appeared on the screen, 1965 film audiences stood and cheered...and his dominating presence still makes the film 'work', today."El Dorado" is, if you are unfamiliar with the film, simply a reworking of 1959's Hawks/Wayne classic, "Rio Bravo", but it stands very well on it's own merits, beginning with the terrific chemistry between Wayne and co-star Robert Mitchum. A very young James Caan offers a funny counterpoint to the two veteran stars, and wonderful character actor, Arthur Hunnicutt (who, for trivia fans, played Davy Crockett in 1955's "The Last Command"...thus making this a unique opportunity to see TWO Davy Crocketts in one film!) plays a rustic variation of Walter Brennan from the earlier film. With plenty of Howard Hawks' signature comraderie, the film is very entertaining."True Grit" is, of course, John Wayne's Oscar-winning role, as pot-bellied, one-eyed Rooster Cogburn. While many believe Wayne won for his career longevity rather than his performance, the film is, in fact, very entertaining and lyrical, and Wayne's portrayal is the glue that holds it together. Certainly, Glen Campbell offers a less-than-stellar performance, but it is more than compensated for by Kim Darby and Robert Duvall, and Wayne, guns blazing, reins clenched in his teeth, provides an image that has become classic.Finally, there is "The Shootist", Wayne's final film. Shot as the Duke's health was declining, dramatically, the production was a difficult one, with director Don Siegel struggling to work with the ailing actor (Co-star Ron Howard would say he learned more about directing from this film, than any other). Because of the Duke's fragile condition, many friends took roles at far below their usual salaries to work with him a last time (including James Stewart, Richard Boone, and Lauren Bacall). The finished film is a labor of love, from the "Classic Wayne" film clips that open the story, to the final gunbattle, with Wayne's character, the cancer-ridden John Bernard Books, going out in a blaze of glory. It may not have been among Wayne's 'best' films, but it was certainly a most fitting end to his career.It's easy to see why this is a worthy Wayne collection to own...But don't take my word for it; buy it, and see for yourself!
1	Exciting western with Brown, Reynolds, and Welch. 100 Rifles will never be considered a great western, but it is a fun watch with plenty of action and a good leading cast.  A Phoenix sheriff, Lyedecker, is pursuing a bank robber, Yaqui Joe a half-breed bandit, and ends up finding him in Mexico amidst an uprising.  Before Lyedecker can bring him in, he is captured alongside Joe who is wanted for giving rifles to the Yaqui Indians by the Mexican Army.  After a narrow escape, Lyedecker forms an uneasy, very uneasy, alliance with Joe to help the Yaquis fight back against the Mexican Army.  100 Rifles is one of many westerns that was released in the late 1960s trying to take advantage of the success of the Italian spaghetti westerns.  It has the feel of spaghettis and was filmed in Almeria, but was American financed.  All that aside, its a very enjoyable western with plenty of action.  Add a great score from Jerry Goldsmith and a great looking print on this new DVD, and you can't miss.Jim Brown stars as Lyedecker, the Phoenix sheriff trying to bring in Yaqui Joe for robbing a bank of $6,000.  Brown isn't considered a great actor, but he's very good here.  The man simply has a great presence on screen.  Burt Reynolds plays Yaqui Joe, a half-breed bandit trying to give rifles to the Yaqui Indians.  His part gives him some very funny lines, and together with Brown, they make a great duo.  Raquel Welch plays Sarita, the love interest who fights alongside the men.  She has a love scene with Brown, that at the time seemed shocking, but its pretty tame.  As expected, Ms. Welch looks amazing, and director Tom Gries gives the viewer plenty of chances to oggle her.  Fernando Lamas plays the evil Verdugo, the Mexican officer charged with wiping out the Yaquis while Eric Braeden offers advice as Von Klemme, a German advisor.  This long-overdue DVD offers a great looking widescreen presentation considering the movie is almost 40 years old, three picture galleries with about 60-70 photos, a 100 Rifles trailer, and trailers for three other 20th Century Fox westerns.  So if you're a fan of westerns, check out Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds, and Raquel Welch in the action-packed 100 Rifles
1	One of my favorite movies of all time. I loved this movie.  It helped me to understand that even though the Professor, (this could be your customer, or your boss) bites your head off, this happens, but it does not diminish you.I loved Kingsfield's Arrogance, earned Arrogance.  It amazes me that some people can achieve so much greatness (yes, I know this is just a movie), but as the first reviewer said, these old men still walk the halls of Harvard (and every other prestigious University in this country).Hart's innocence and his experience learning (I really enjoyed the TV series, and this to the downfall of TV, that such a great series did not last, or at least barely made it into syndication on Public TV for a short time)The young married student, sorry I have forgotten his name, the one with the "Photographic Memory"...  I loved it when he went over to the 3-L student's house, and the student gave him a hypothetical to work up and he'd figure out where his shortcomings in the Law were, and he'd help him merely from the answers he gives to the hypothetical.What a great movie about Great men (and women).  Again, those men and women set the standards for our lives today.  In our Government, Courts, Schools etc
1	Good Action. Not just another action film, but one with a stroy behind it. Makes you think about whether or not we will ever be safe in the USA again
1	Touching story about growing up gay in the black community. This touching drama lets you see how growing up gay has changed over two generations in the African American community in the United States.  I believe that this movie was one of the most under exposed looked movies of the year.
1	Brilliant! he knows how to make you laugh. The funniest show around!This is the funniest show i've seen since Mad TV. Dave Chappelle is a genius. I put him up with Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy any day.This dvd was crazy. I really loved the Crack Head (Tyrone Biggums). You really need to get this dvd. You do not know what you are missing!!!!
