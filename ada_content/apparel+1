GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME. AND COMFORTABLE. AND RELATIVELY CHEAP. I'LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH'S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS</review_text>
These sunglasses are all right. They were a little crooked, but still cool..</review_text>
I don't see the difference between these bodysuits and the more expensive ones.  Fits my boy just right</review_text>
Very nice basic clothing.  I think the size is fine.  I really like being able to find these shades of green, though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color.  This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens</review_text>
I love these socks. They fit great (my 15 month old daughter has thick ankles) and she can zoom around on the kitchen floor and not take a nose dive into things. :</review_text>
Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.  Thanks!!</review_text>
Your company was a pleasure to work with- thanks!  I will enjoy wearing the swimsuit that I ordered</review_text>
very portable. great picture. easy to operate. all the accessories you need. great sound. playes dvd's from sony camcorder. very happy with the system. am looking forward to using this camping and on vacation.</review_text>
I have been looking for a pair of Docs for a while. I know they are a new globalized company, and I am not necessarily against that.I am disappointed that you can't get a better range of colors. I've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green. But colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name. An abomination for sure!These shoes are very comfortable and apparently well-made. My single quibble with the black pair I got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue. I like a nice strong tongue. (And who doesn't?) Whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake. On the other hand, maybe the sole will wear out first (or it will be a dead heat).Never thought I'd buy shoes online, but amazon and the Doctor made it happen.</review_text>
The quality is much better than expected. I bought one for myself and one for my husband prior to our Las Vegas trip Sept. 6, 2005. We were able to walk with or hands free because these fannypacks held all of the necessities, our cell phones, travelers checks, keys, and medicines in particular. We love the spacious divided compartments. I highly reccommend this product..</review_text>
Nice shirt. Well made. Good price. What more can I say</review_text>
The shirts are what I had asked for.  They are sturdy and well made.  I would buy more if I needed more.  Well worth the money spen</review_text>
I love wearing those tank tops with shelf bras or summer dresses that can't be worn with a bra...but the nipple issue was quite vexing. I didn't feel comfortable with any nip protrusion...the only disadvantage in having implants is that they tend to be a bit nipply. But, problem solved. These things rock</review_text>
I was having a hard time finding a cheaper swim suit so I just ordered one from the grab bag.  I figured nothing could be worse than my plain black swim suit.  Also the swim suit was delivered in half the time that it was expected</review_text>
It's golden color is very remarkable ..It looks like real gold..wonderful piece to have</review_text>
With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style, to say I love these shoes is an understatement. They are very comfortable, and have grown on me so much, they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years</review_text>
A difficult item to find in department stores.  Found some at twice the price in a leather goods store.  The Fossil leather key cases were of equal quality.  I purchased two and am very satisfied</review_text>

The collar stays are great!  They came in a convenient little container, and now I'm not searching all over the laundry room floor for the collar stays that fell out of my husband's dress shirts.  The different lengths were helpful because he has different style shirts, and the collar stays came very quickly</review_text>
Okay, this cap is really stylish. But I think the sewing isn't quite finished. There were loose threads all over my caps when I got them. Not to mention the parts that weren't even sewed... no threads at all</review_text>
I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open  nearly to the waist, and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little, nobody would be able to see anything. The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin, so they were perfect. They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold. The best part was, they didn't feel weird at all</review_text>
These are some really good glasses.  Plenty dark, full mirrored so you won't be caught checkin out all the ladies you walk by.  Shoot, for $18 you can't go wrong.  I highly recommend them.  And since I'm a pilot, it was obvious that I got a pair of these</review_text>
I found these at Lane Bryant and I absolutely love them! I wear them under my work clothes every day. You've got to try them</review_text>
About 18-24 months ago, we purchased a pair of beach CROCS for our daughter, child-toddler size 12-13, like those pictured. She has used them for the beach, around the pool, wearing them to school on non-gym days, going on non-strenuous walks, and so forth. Plus, we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools. Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2, she still wears them. And, the shoes are in good shape! Also, daughter's mother has been wearing her own pair, for similar uses, for about two years. So, we highly recommend CROCS</review_text>
I got this handbag for my 14th birthday and I looove it so much!!It is so perfect, the best chanel handbag there is. Everyone that saw my new handbag loved it and asked where I bought. I actually bought it at nordstrom. Everyone should have one!!BUY IT</review_text>
I can only ditto what the other 5-star reviewers have already said. I have 1 of the 41" for summer and now 2 of the 50" for fall and winter. The colors remain solid after mutiple washes, and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts. Also very comfortable. Highly recommend! ngmackie, Dunwoody, GA</review_text>
must have shoe for bunion and hammertoe sufferers. i also have very hot sweaty feet and these are an excellent choice if you share these problems. very large toe box and excellent webbing for ventilation.  very good looking comfortable shoes .  only qualification is that if you stand on your feet all day or do a lot of walking you may want to pick a shoe with more support --these are very lightweight shoes but lack the support a heavier athletic shoe would offer-- but those type of shoes are usually harder on bunions and my feet get extremely hot in them</review_text>
My mother is an avid world traveler and is quite particular about how she travels. So, I bought her the cabin cuddler for her birthday and she loves it! And I quote "It is practical and functional and makes a huge difference (re: comfort) for those long international flights." Big hit!</review_text>
I bought this scarf with a gift certificate I received for Christmas.  I love it so much and my kids love it so much they are buying their own.  It is super-warm and retains it shape, even after my nine year old tried it on as a dress</review_text>
I'm taking off one point only because these pants don't have the short/medium/long choice as other BDU pants do.  I'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline.  For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34'' and inseam up to 34-35''.  For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.  I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend.Other than that I'm happy with the product quality and the service I received</review_text>
Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place</review_text>
Clever and stylish design; a lot of colors to choose from; and an excellent performance, best sport shoe eve</review_text>
Awesome shoes. Not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless. I'd recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously, and who likes to look even cooler when doing it.</review_text>
This is a top quality item. I is an 80%/20% cotton/poly mix-double stitched seams...very well made. I bought a 2X for my son who ususally wears a 3X, and after putting it through the washer and dryer twice, it's just as perfect as the day it was delivered.</review_text>
These shoes are awesome, I have bowled with them for the past couple of weeks and they are just what I was looking for. The color is hot and everyone on my league noticed them and said very positive things about them. Thanks for the super fast shipping and supurb quailty</review_text>
My husband loves this coat. He wears it all winter. If you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it. He is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect. Warm enough and lightweight and comfortable. THis is the second one he has purchased.</review_text>
I have been using this for awhile now.  Unlike some sports bras that are this supportive, it's a lighter weight material/construction.  I wouldn't say that there probably isn't something better out there and it isn't cheap - but it's not bad.  For my peers that have this 'issue', you know what I'm talking about!:</review_text>
Before this bra, I would have to wear an underwire bra, and a sports bra on top to minimize bounce. My cup size is F, so it's been difficult to find a sports bra that I can wear standalone.Well folks, I found it. THIS IS THE BRA!! I wore it while doing turbo jam today and it was AMAZING! It did better than the two bra combination ever did. If you're looking for a sports bra that actually WORKS, this is the one</review_text>
I got the flip flops for my granddaughter for christmas she wore her  cheap ones out from wal-mart and her mother told her white is summer only and no one could find white ones right now I told her I bet her I could and so I did and she loves them and so did all her friends at school. we know it is winter but so far in indiana it is not bad so you can wear flip flops and tanks for now. thank you for  the great gift.</review_text>
This is just the thing to put away for a Christmas gift.  Nice product in a nice box, tied with a bow.</review_text>
I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.The quality of the fabric is substantial enough to hold large (and engorging) breasts without the need for a bra.  It is strong but breathable, and not flimsy so it slightly smoothes out quirks of the pregnant body.The length is a little longer than most - it slightly covers my knees -  which is what I wanted so slit is nice to have for normal strides walking, easing out of bed, hiking up to use the washroom, etc. without tearing the seams.As the description and the other review indicates, the cups can slide down for pumping or nursing.I'm very happy with the colors, design, and construction of all items.  Due to the volume of my order (directly from the [...] site, I received a high quality FREE minky dot chenille blanket that came rolled and ribboned in a nice tulle bag.  I would definitely get this for other expectant or new moms</review_text>
I was looking for a good nursing nightgown to wear while in the hospital after giving birth to my second child.  I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.After purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's "customs broker" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.I purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.The gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt.The gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.The bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.Overall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit</review_text>
The sheets were just as described and worth the price. Timely on shippng also. Very pleased</review_text>
The Crib sheets were soft, the service fast and they fit the Pack and Play mattress</review_text>
This sheet is great solution for difficult to change crib sheets- just lay it over the top of your pretty sheet and snap it to the crib frame.  I highly recommend it to those who don't like wrestling the crib sheet onto the mattress</review_text>
Service was very quick, and they were having a free shipping special, so it was very well priced</review_text>
Ordered these bra extenders since I an pregnant and now having trouble fitting into things, and they are working great!  Recevied them very quickly and they are exactly as I expected! Thanks!</review_text>
I never buy stuff like this on line.  I like to play with/feel wallets before getting them.  But I couldn't find a thin, bi-fold that I liked, so I took a chance.It's great.  The ID feature is super handy (it comes all the way out if you're wondering).  And the brown leather is soft and nice.  It is really nice for the price.(By the way, personally, I don't think it's thick at all)</review_text>
The shoes are better then expected.. Everyone comments on how nice they are and where did you get them.. I will let anyone know to buy the</review_text>
I had never ordered from this company before. I have now ordered quite a few things from them. For the price, everything has been very attractive. Some of the sizes run a bit small.This dress is very sweet, the PAPRIKA color is an orange, but I ordered 3 of these in different colors. Nice to wear around the house during the summer.( I also ordered a nice dress in EGGPLANT, but it is really brown, alright with me, a nice dress.)Customer Service was very good to me, and I even received a coupon for 3 free magazine subscriptions, as I had ordered over a certain amount from Newport News.I am happy with the price vs. quality of all of their things. Shipping was very speedy.For these prices you do not get the quality of Neiman's, Sak's, or Bloomie's  - but you get many more nice, simple, summer dresses, of a decent quality. I think that Newport News offers good value, and service for the money</review_text>
I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The jeans are great quality for the price. However, it was not stated that they would be the (very)long length that they were. I had to alter them, which was an inconvenience</review_text>
Love these boxers. I stole a pair from a friend a while back and had to have a pair of my own. Love the fabric and the cut, not too long not too short, and just the right amount of butt room.</review_text>
I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.As for the comment that these fit smaller than most, I didn't have that experience. In Nike, Reebok, Gap, and Rusell Athletic tshirts, I wear a large. I wear a large in Artiga as well, and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing</review_text>
I highly reccommend this bag for anyone! It is a big tote, which is perfect for a college campus, the airport, the beach... really for any purpose. It is reversable and I was very suprised at how durable it is (great quality). When people compliment the bag it allows an opportunity to share its cause- which in the end is the most important part.</review_text>
I have used this mat almost everytime I've been outdoors.  I haven't seen anything like it at any department store and its much cheaper than the mats at the beachside boutiques.  It is an awesome value for the price.</review_text>
THEY CALL THEIR SOCKS THE "WORLDS SOFTEST MEN'S CLASSIC CREW SOCK" AND LET ME TELL YOU ITS THE TRUTH. BEEN LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF RED SOCKS FOR WEEKS, WITH OUT SUCCESS. THEY MAY NOT BE THE SHADE OF RED I WANTED BUT THEY ARE THE BEST IN FIT AND QUALITY. NOW FIND ME THE "RED SHADE" I'M LOOKING FOR AND I'LL BE EVEN MORE PLEASED.Norb Reynders.......yes over 13... going on 7</review_text>
Nice, soft leatherette. The inside is roomy, and the pic is fairly accurate for the size to body ratio. The tie-front detail stays so, you don't have to worry about it unraveling or loosening. Nice silver buckle accents on strap. Great</review_text>
I ordered 2 for gifts and 1 for myself based on other reviews. I was not disappointed! The bag is large and roomy, made of heavy-duty material, with outside pocket, and has a neat little clasp to hook your keys, etc. for easy finding.  It will make the perfect beach bag for us, and could be used for almost anything.</review_text>
These are great girl socks! Besides being economical, they feel good, wash good, are very stylish, and don't fall down! They look great with jeans and khakis. I have ordered several more pairs, in different colors. A true value</review_text>
The Nine West Botamy boots are comfortable and really well made. The leather is very soft also. Even though the toe is very pointed, these boots are still comfortable. Amazon has a great price on these boots</review_text>
Genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear! An excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather, well worth the money spent.</review_text>
I purchased these boots for my daughter for christmas. I was a little nervouse because she wanted the ugg boots. With four children sometimes a compromise is in order so when I saw these at a more reasonable price, I got them. When she opened them, she at first didn't even realize they weren't the ugg's. She has been wearing them since and I'm guessing started a new trend because others have been asking her where she got them and they also like the cost. In comparison to the more expensive boots, she says "no difference"</review_text>
I was very pleased with the socks.  They were just what we were looking for!  Thanks so much</review_text>
I purchased this bra on a special for 6.50. Well worth that price. i am thinking of purchasing more at the current price. very comfortable and great fit----great everyday bra for larger chests (I am a 38D</review_text>
i've got really sensitive feet and i get blisters really easily, sometimes within 5mins of wearing a new pair of shoes. my quest for the comfortable ballet flat has ended here, after months of searching! the heel is nice and soft but there's still sufficient support here (for me that is. for those of you out there with back problems, it might not be sufficient). i got them in the gold, which is a gorgeous pale lame, and am currently lusting over the black :</review_text>
Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too</review_text>
As manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present "one size fits all,"it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands. These shoesare well made and an excellent value. The only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow. The heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case</review_text>
This is an outstanding shoe!  It has good support, looks great and cleans easily.  The price is comparable to any good quality, kids', athletic shoe.  An excellent choice for an active athlete who hasn't yet grown into adult sizes.</review_text>
i was very satisfied with my purchase of these items.reasonable price and am very happy with items</review_text>
it means so much to me to be able to buy a pair of jeans that fit me in length.  ya who.Am</review_text>
I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived. They fit my husband's feet well and he likes them. The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace.</review_text>
The slippers are great!  They do seem to be on the large side of a 15.  My husband had to put paper in the toes.  He wears 15 in every thing else</review_text>
I was so impressed with the quality and correct sizing for this suit.  My little guy looked so grown-up and handsome in his new suit!! Thanks so much !</review_text>
Not best for running but look very cool.  comfortable enough to wear for styl</review_text>
One of the most comfortable bras I've ever worn.  I own several, and they're just about all I'll wear!  Very nice fit, and good look under clothes</review_text>
I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug. But otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined. I just love this modern addition,and it's not too "young" feeling, just right.</review_text>
I got this jacket last week, I liked it for the price i paid</review_text>
Single Style, good shoes. I think is a nice choice to every day work</review_text>
They look nice and feel AMAZING.  I bought my husband 2 and as soon as they arrived he asked me to buy him a few more.  They're great and the cushion doesn't 'flatten out' in the wash</review_text>
My friend was very happy with them.  They are very good quality, and they fit him for the most part.  The only issue we had was the length of the arms.  They were a little too long.  Other than that, we were pleased.  They got here in time for Christmas, and they were just what he wanted</review_text>
Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up</review_text>
I LOVE these shoes...I have been searching for the right ballet/audrey hepburn style flats for years. I also love the price</review_text>
It's a very durable bag. I run trails a lot and I was looking for something to carry my running items during the winter season, durable as well as comfortable, and cheap so I don't have to worry about ripping it. The straps are padded and feel really secure on my shoulders. The part that lays across your back is nicely padded and has already saved me on some nasty spills. And if you need it for books, the padding will keep the books from poking your back. I would imagine it would be a bit hot on your back in the summer though.I expect I will tear it to shreds eventually, but for the price it's worth it.</review_text>
The fit is great. Sexy slim look and feel. Slight stretch to add to comfort and hugging feel of the denim. Got lots of compliments</review_text>
the price for the slippers was average- no big discount, but they arrived at my front door in time for Christmas. That was a big plus. And my daughter loved them</review_text>
Very cute tops, for a nice price.  They wash up good.  They do run a little big, just so you are aware</review_text>
The beading on the bag is fantastic, and its very cute.  The color is even more exquisite in person.  It's just big enough to hold ID, a little money, and a lipstick, perfect for going out at night</review_text>
my hubby liked this shirt -it was a great christmas present</review_text>
They are perfect for kids daily lunches.  Would like to order more but don't where to start. Lost all the ordering information</review_text>
i purchased this bag recently for an overseas trip (along with the 20" nxt roller) and i'm very happy with it.  the styling and fit is excellent, and it holds more than i expected.  it's comfortable to hold in your hand or to sling over your shoulder.  i purchased the black version.  with victorinox's lifetime guarantee you can't go wrong!  amazon.com is very competitive on price on this bag, and though there were a few stores that were cheaper i felt it was worth it to go with amazon if only because i trust them</review_text>
My son loved these jeans.  The jeans were very comfortable. The best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect</review_text>
Good quality workmanship, very authentic looking and sizes are easy to fit.I would buy another one.robert</review_text>
Soft, durable, breathable fabric.  Perfectly flexible for vigorous practice.  I'm glad I bought these</review_text>
THE BOOT IS GREAT BUT IT DOES RUN A WEE BIT LARGE, IF BETWEEN SIZES, GO DOWN NOT UP IF YOU WANT A CLOSER TO REAL FIT. THEY ARE FUN AND DO THE JOB WELL</review_text>
It's really hard to buy scrub pants on-line because everyone is different. Cherokee always fits perfectly and good quality. I think they should consider a wider array of sizes in petite. By the time I finished hemming them, I didn't have that cute slit at the bottoms. They wash well and wear well</review_text>
The item is much better than any others that I have got through out the years. It should last a long time. Not rip easy. It feels very sturdy. I think it is real good</review_text>
This jacket and pants are not the high end breathable rain gear you want on a week long backpacking trip. This is the rain gear you keep in your pickup truck for when you least expect. It will keep you perfectly dry. You will sweat a little on a warm day, but it is well worth the money for a cheap, dependable and totally waterproof suit. enjoy the rain and mud.</review_text>
I own lots of shoes...but I don't wear them...truth be told, I detest having things on my feet. I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my "Birks". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them "Birks" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.I own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the "nice ones". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.I'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks.Are they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.So get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.I firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy. So bless your soles with a gift from the gods. You'll be glad you did.</review_text>
These are very cute and they fit great.  I wear them all the time</review_text>
ordering was easy, arrived in 4 days, gloves fit, well and good quality, good buy,recommend  to purchas</review_text>
When I play basketball, or in the past when I did Jiu-Jitsu then too. Anyway, they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels don't pull or cramp. Anyway, I guess they look o.k. too, but who would see them anyway...THEY'RE UNDERWEAR!!!!take care and good luck</review_text>
I LOVE this shoe!It's a perfect heel height, classic pointed toe, comfortable design with coverage enough to enclose even a wider foot. Perfectly proportioned with all-day comfort.If I win Lotto, I plan to order every color with spares in case it's ever discontinued.The natural leather is lovely, but scuffs easily. I strongly recommend buffing with neutral polish or saddle soap/oil to give it a bit of durability.HIGHLY recommended, even for wider feet!</review_text>
This is not a basket short or soccer short, NO!!!! it's a very very nice beach short or just to sunnys day specialy in my country... With hot beaches all year, and beatyfull shopping mall near you can use this shorts for both activities.. That's why i bought it and don't mess the shoppin</review_text>
Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either.I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.</review_text>
I have to say, those crocs are the best. they are super confi, and light... I recommend them</review_text>
These shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift, walking on concrete floors</review_text>
I purchased a pair of these shoes several months ago in a goldish/platinum color.  They were so comfortable that I purchased two more pair in different colors!  The straps are VERY comfortable - they're elastic and not tight or constraining.  The shoe leather is very soft and not hard on your toes.  I can wear these shoes for both the AM and PM services to church, where I usually have to wear a different pair for the PM service because my feet hurt so bad!  It's hard to find a comfortable pair of heels, so when you can find them, stock up on them</review_text>
This purse has a lot of positives going for it:1. Great design - the embroidery is very intricate and detailed and looks gorgeous.2. The color is very glamorous.3. It is a deal at this price (although I bought it when it was $5 higher)4. It is unique and I love it because I am unique :)In short, I love it</review_text>
I have arms like a gorilla, so I was pleasantly surprised at the length of these sleeves. They fit even my appendages nicely. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and I'm glad I did, for the large is a perfect fit on me, and I'm pretty slender. The material is fairly thin, but not see-through. Overall, I say this shirt is a good value</review_text>
I never seem to have luck shopping for bras, so just took a chance on these off of another review that I had read.  They were a great deal and a wonderful fit.  I would highly recommend</review_text>
This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport, but beware, it runs really narrow.  I even went a size up from my usual to compensate.  I ended-up sending them back anyway.  So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal</review_text>
This isn't a review of this product, so much as it's a review of the impression it makes.  Anyone who was in Paris around the turn of the century will remember Aubade's "Lecons de Seduction" advertising campaign, of which the image shown here for this "tanga" was a part.  Each item of lingerie featured in the ads featured a little piece of advice to the wearer as to how she could use this item to make the right sort of  impression ... and isn't that just what frilly little underthings like this are for?  Nothing has made a stronger impression on us</review_text>
I followed the advice of the reviewers before me and ordered them a half size bigger than I normally would and they fit great!  Super cute with jeans or a sexy dress!  Great job Jessica</review_text>
These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!</review_text>
Highly recommend shoe, BUT you might need a larger size than usual. I wear Easy Spirit 7 1/2 W but found this shoe too snug in both width and length, and had to return</review_text>
These are the first mootsies tootsies I have owned and I love em.Since then I have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots.  These shoes are very comfortable</review_text>
The presentation of the product is claer and attractive and the product is durable, comfortable and goodlooking</review_text>
THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT I HAVE BEEN PUCHASING FOR 15 PLUS YEARS. CAN I ORDER MONOGRAMED SHIRTS FROM THIS SITE</review_text>
I gave this shoes to my girlfriend and she just love them, she says they are really confortable, and i find them really pretty. A really good buy it is</review_text>
Ordering online and not being able to try on clothing can be risky but it paid off with this purchase. I just wish it wasn't "hand wash only".</review_text>
I originally started wearing Hanky Panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back. Recently I stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again I'm thrilled.I wear low rise jeans, shorts, etc and these low rise thong panties take the worry out of showing off my back side when I bend over or pick something up. I never feel as though I need to reach back to check to see if I'm giving a show or not! They're just as comfortable as the others -- the just ride lower on your hips. They're very sexy too!I suggest ordering from Bare Necessities b/c they offer free shipping with any $40 purchase. That's three pairs of thongs -- you can't beat that. And... once you try these you'll be hooked like me and be ordering them in every color!Go for it!!!</review_text>
I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.</review_text>
As a new 36DD (can't wear underwire) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market.  For the past 5 years (since my surgery) I've been searching for the perfect bra.  I have finally found it!</review_text>
recipient was very satisfied with this blanket as PB are his initials</review_text>
A friend suggested these shoes for waltzing around the neighborhood. I will never forget that day.The first thing you must know about these shoes is that they are horribly uncomfortable at first. With stiff plastic boards attached to your feet, you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money. Soon, however, they start to mold to your feet. They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.I love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months. With time, and care, my feet are better. But I can't go back to these amazing shoes.My suggestion is to wear them sparingly.</review_text>
These are wonderful sandals. Tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail. Finally did the right thing and went online. Great Sandals at a very reasonable price. You won't be sorry if you purchase these. Very stylish and very comfortable</review_text>
these are the most warm and comfortable slippers.  i would recommend these to everyone</review_text>
can't believe how true to size they are. They're quite easy to move in, and they're simple and beautiful. Not at all cheap-looking for the price. I expected less and got more</review_text>
I love this shoe! It looks very elegant on the foot and there's a little bit toe cleavage which is always a plus! But make sure to go half a size up. It's a little snug in the front and it takes a couple wears to break it in.</review_text>
I love Puma shoes--especially the Future Cat Low.  Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I've ever had.  The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average, but you get what you pay for.  They are great-looking and are extremely comfortable.  I am so pleased with these shoes that I plan on only purchasing sneakers from Puma from now on.  I've bought four different Future Cats: dark shadow/persimmon orange, black/white/Chinese red, white/black/vapour blue, and black coffee/white/burnt olive</review_text>
Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.Believe me, this trunk truly has a pouch. A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.Of course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this "no-show." I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)For me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.This pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not "cling" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor.The waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.May I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier!I cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection</review_text>
Purchased these for my husband. He absolutely loves these sandals. He initially thought the little nubbies would feel strange. However, he got over that thought fast when he slipped them on and went tromping around the yard. He uses them for a quick slip-on shoe to run outdoors. Wears them every day. Thanks for a nice slip-on! Also these are sturdy though very light weight</review_text>
These are exactly what I was looking for.  I've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years.  Everytime I break or lose a pair I spend months looking for its replacement.  After I received my first pair, I ordered enough to last me another 20 years.  I hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days.  They are uncomfortable and they cost more</review_text>
I'm in love with these sandals.  Although they are very lightweight, they are vastly more substantial, supportive and comfortable than most flip-flops.  I may have to buy another pair.  If you're a half-size, go down not up</review_text>
I bought these because I normally can't wear a shoe without my orthodic insert. These are great. Very comfortable. I plan on living in them this summer.I bought a size 8 croc which was fine. These were on the big size so I exchanged them for the next smaller size. I guess I am a 7 and 1/2 so if you are inbetween sizes, go smaller with the Athens Croc</review_text>
I love these Crocs!  They are much more comfortable than the original style, and I like the two tone color combo.  I wear them even in the winter</review_text>
This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank.</review_text>
The jersey of our #54 got here for my wife in time for Super Bowl and she was very happy.(With the jersey NOT Grossman</review_text>
My 11 year old wanted these shoes. All her friends at school thought they were so cooland want a pair. Plus they slip on and off so quick and are great for PE and the palyground. I would buy these shoes again, without a doubt. Keds makes a wonderful product and I think she'll out grow them before they even think about wearing out. Great value for the money.</review_text>
These shoes are so comfy!  I love the no shoe string thing too.  Easy and comfortable.  What more could you ask for</review_text>
I just received this bag today and I am absolutely in love with it.This bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is HUGE!!! With a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player. My husband got it 100% right with this little surprise. So if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price!!!</review_text>
Both our son and his wife and myself are very pleased with the undershirts. It was very difficult to find the shirts that openned on the side, so I appreciate them being offered on your site and will remember the brand in the future.</review_text>
The Lilyette Maximum Support bra is well made and wears well.  It holds up to frequent washings and retains its support features.  It is comfortable</review_text>
I have just recieved my pair of boxer-briefs for my son.  I took A kid's review's idea and got one size smaller for my son.  I asked him how they felt and he said that they felt really good.  I asked him if they give him enough support and he said yes and he even told me, I don't know why, but he told me that he can get his hand down the boxer-briefs and take it out without the boxer-briefs streching and loosing their tightness</review_text>
I travel a lot, especially during the summer months, and these packs are the best thing since Ziplock bags!!  They are a must, in all sizes, for the traveler.  Helps things and people get/stay organized; an absolute must!!</review_text>
I love naughty monkey! I'm so happy with their shoes! They don't hurt my feet</review_text>
This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box.  It looks great with a skirt or slacks.   My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy.  I have the shoe in black.  If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available</review_text>
I bought these slippers for my mother, who is 5 years post stroke.  She has difficulty keeping shoes and slippers on because she has no feeling in her left foot since her stroke.  Also she is always cold even when it is 80+ degrees outside.  These slippers have been wonderful.  They fit her well, they stay on and they keep her feet warm.When she wears these out will definitly by another pair</review_text>
Don't know where else to find a garter panty set (arrived fast too) for this price. They say economy, so wasn't expecting much, but we're still enjoying this set to spice up special evenings! We bought the One Size (for a size 8) and it is perfect and adjusts</review_text>
Podría ser extraño regalar una prenda de ropa íntima, pero estos Boxer son lo máximo para regalar desde un primo hasta a un compañero de estudios, y claro para la pareja - e incluso para chicas. Son de algodón, muy suaves frescos y ligeros. Los compré talla M y auqnue son para un caballero delgado uno M de Medio llenito los puede usar con comodidad. Para mi gusto son un poco largos, pero eso también provee de comodidad a su usuario. esto es más que una prenda de ropa interior es algo que provoca lucir y ver lucir. El estampado fue toda una celebración "Saluda a mi pequeño amigo"!!!!!!, con este Boxer puedes pasearte en interiores en tu casa y a nadie le va a molestar</review_text>
Good quality jeans at an affordable price. Size is just right, quite comfortable</review_text>
I bought these for my son for Christmas, they were first quality, arrived in time for christmas,and at a great price</review_text>
They are exactly what I was hoping they would be.  I love the contoured front pouch.  All the web sites I saw and read about them said you may want to order 1 size larger then normal.  I would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit.  My wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel.  I ordered 4 different pairs of Unico's and they're all good quality and look and feel great</review_text>
The slippers were perfect, exactly what I wanted.  The price was good and they were delivered sooner then I expected.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and it was so easy to do. Thank You very much</review_text>
Great slippers, very comfortable. I love the fact that the front is open in case I just got a pedicure.  And the black ones are perfect because they don't show dirt like the white ones</review_text>
Super comfortable.  Provides great support/coverage.  Love the front zipper.  No fighting to get over your head.</review_text>
These boots are so warm and soft! I usually wear a 7.5 and I ordered them in size 7 (even though they recommend sizing up for half sizes) and they fit perfectly. An awesome (and cheaper) alternative to Uggs</review_text>
Very comfortable - looks great - makes it easy to move around in bed</review_text>
I LOVE my new Steve Maddens!  They are brand new as described and I received them verrrry quickly</review_text>
This is a nice shirt, not as warm as we had hoped though. The lining is quite thin. It washes fairly well, loses a bit of its shape but not a lot. A great shirt for the fall. Its roomy & comfortable</review_text>
They were a nice quality, nicely priced, and were shipped promptly.  I would buy this brand again</review_text>
My mother loves these pants.  I know they are for men, but she loves the way they fit her.  They are stain resisnt and that makes them that much better.</review_text>
I love this product, and the rest of the Pack-It system, beyond all reason.  I've given them as gifts repeatedly.In effect, they give you "drawers" in your suitcase, and sub-drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers.  It's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else.The 18" folder works well for womens' shirts, blouses, and slacks.  I can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it.  If you want to carry more or fewer pieces, it's forgiving.  I use it for suit jackets too, folding them in across the width of the folder.I've used mine often over perhaps 8 years, and they still look like new.A standard-sized 21" roll-aboard suitcase will neatly hold: 1 18-inch folder (this product), two full-sized Pack-It cubes, a small pack-it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers, a toiletries bag (not from this sytem) and a pair of shoes (squeezed).  It also works to omit the cubes and use two 18" folders, depending on the clothes being packed.</review_text>
I bought this bra because I was tired of seeing "nursing bra" lines under my shirts.  This is great.  I bought the L++ and it fits perfectly.  I am a 38DDD normally and durring my pregnancy a 40DDD was fitting too.  If you buy this bra, you will love it, just buy the correct size</review_text>
This is just the perfect accessory for the CATS costume one of my dancers is using for our dance recital. Got this in gray and brown too! Took a while for the product to get here. In fact, I had to re-order because of the delay--but when finally the product arrived, it was worth the wait</review_text>
Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.</review_text>
I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the $20 coupon and as usual, scored with free shipping. Clarks' quality is tops and the prices were great, too!I got these in earth color. They look really good with jeans. Comfy with or without socks. The soles are gonna last a while.These have some nice cush to them, and provide good support to my high-arched, tired feet</review_text>
i don't have a lot of experience with compression shorts, but i am very pleased with this product. the fabric does not lose compression over time (although i've only had them a short time). the fit is good, the fabric is comfortable. i've gotten into the habit of sleeping in them, and they work great for keeping you toasty. i wish products like this were around during the years i played college soccer</review_text>
I like the flip case. It is exactly what i wanted. However,the clip has fallen off a few times when i hit it.</review_text>
FIT IS PERFECT.  VERY COMFORTABLE.  4 STARS.   WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN.MARY S</review_text>
These black satin Isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well. They are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet, as well. They are well worth the purchase</review_text>
I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than $30, retail price, even on sale, was $60. The jacket arrived in about a week. Its nice and warm, very good quality. The upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. It fits great and looks good. Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. But all in all I'm very pleased</review_text>
Fit well.  Great for all kinds of athletic workouts.  I'm ready to buy a couple more pairs</review_text>
For the money, these are a great value.  Unlike a comment above, I have not found these short at all, but average in length</review_text>
love these little gems... perfect at 1 size below normal size.you won't want to take them off</review_text>
I bought these slippers as a Christams gift for my 16 year old daughter, she was very happy to get them as I guess they are the "in" thing for teenagers in her school. She loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy! Price is high, but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper, these are more like shoes than slippers. The sheep skin & wool lining is very sturdy & luxerious</review_text>
I really like these.  I do recommend getting a size smaller. I normally wear and 8.5 and ordered a 7 and they fit perfectly. super comfortable!</review_text>
Yeh, these are really great socks... but what's up with James? If new socks changed my life, hey I need to get a little something goin' on. Back to the socks...my favorite, in black, low cut, workin' out or hangin' out</review_text>
I love this jacket.   It is lightweight but still warm enough to wear in all but the coldest weather.  It is also long enough to cover my rear.  Very good in the rain, too</review_text>
My boyfriend loves tommy socks but they are impossible to find in New Mexico and I have looked everywhere for them.  I gave them to him for christmas and he thought they were the greates</review_text>
This is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps, just like I used to do before I got bored with knitting. It's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me; I just cut off the tag and people think I made it myself. (Don't tell!)Not high fashion, but very warm and comfortable</review_text>
I bought this for my boyfriend. It is soft and comfy. It is definitely comfy for me to snuggle with. And as a bonus he likes it too. My only complaint is that the sleeves are little too long. But overall we are very happy with the purchase</review_text>
I love this skirt.I wear it with my "Live a Little" denim jacket, so cute.I find it to be really figure flattering.I ordered a size 6 and it fit perfect.Nice to find a denim skirt that's a little different than the other zillions out there</review_text>
I like Bike swimmer jocks. I think they look better and are more comfortable then the standard old jocks with waist bands that are too big and can roll and pinch you. This is all you need to keep you in place. They don't cover any more than they need to. They're all you need when you jog (I don't think anyone actually wears them swimming anymore). The swimmer jock style in general is like that, regardless of the manufacturer. However, I'm giving it a 4 because I prefer jocks in non-cotton fabrics like nylon, polyester, and Coolmax. They are much softer and can whick better. Plus, there are now ones that look more modern and have funkier colors, such as ones by Calvin Klein and Baskit. Why not add to your fun when you jog?</review_text>
I ordered this bra as well as the Olga Women's Perfect Fit Full Figure, black, 38DDD.  This bra provides much better lift, support and separation than the Olga.  I think it is because the cups are seamed.  I'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature (I'm 5'2"), and also has a large bra size (I'm a 36DDD).</review_text>
I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great.</review_text>
If you are a grandma on a budget, it can be difficult to find useful items for grandsons.  I thought that this was a good buy at $7.99 for my 11-year old grandson for either his birthday or Christmas.  I would have given five stars, but there was not a complete list of teams offered</review_text>
These thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight.  They are also a shiny patent material.  These are the pluses.  The one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot.  That is, the toe piece seems a bit long.  I kept them because I know I will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house.  I also do not think that they are really worth the price.  Yes, they are Tommy Hilfiger, but the name is all you are really paying for.  They are an okay shoe, overall - not my favorites</review_text>
i have purchased other hats from well known companies. these hats are great for the money and are constructed well. good job!</review_text>
Stretches to fit you exactly.  The smooth fabric holds everything in place.  Contrast waistband and package support make this underwear look very sexy.  Highly recommended</review_text>
These sweatpants are extremely comfortable, reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors...Definetly a great buy..</review_text>
I found this product to be of very high quality and the transaction of the product was great.I recommend this for anyone looking for great bag, especially as a gift</review_text>
i regret to say that i did not receive the shoes..!!</review_text>
I am very happy with my velour slippers .They are a perfect fit and very comfortable.I received my order promptly and plan to order again in the future</review_text>
The shirt came fast.It's a good quality shirt.I'm satisfied with it</review_text>
This is great.  I measured before I put it on & after.  I lost over 2 inches.  I highly recommend this</review_text>
I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.  I've already placed another large order, as Christmas gifts for my friends!</review_text>
I really like this case, it fits so perfectly that the Zen doesn't rattle around or anything, yet all the plugs and buttons are still accessible.  Easy to get on and off, too, and looks great</review_text>
These keep your feet warm and toastie. Will want more when these wear out</review_text>
This is a lovely, lovely bra.  It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing.  The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear.  The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor.  The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.  Yes, you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye, St. Olga</review_text>
It is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys...instead of me carrying them!!!</review_text>
I bought it for my boyfriend for the gym.  He would carry all his extra gym clothes, wallet, keys, and phone all bundled up in his arms and shove everything in the locker dropping everything along the way.  He really likes it and especially the extra front pocket allows him to seperate small stuff. Not very many other products have that extra pocket.  Very sturdy material and the size is just right</review_text>
This is a Great Gown for the price. It's comfy, soft, and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there. Moreover, it's sexy! Hope yall enjoy</review_text>
Very happy with this product. They are substantial so they are &quot;suitable&quot; for a Medium or Large and not someone who is Small.Delivery was fast and it was well packed. Shipping was included, though I didn't realize it until the end of the ordering process.</review_text>
After i tired Jockey No Line Promise Hip Brief , i will never purchased anything els</review_text>
These boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking.  They are comfortable and a great buy.  A nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe</review_text>
The service was expedient and the bras fit perfectly.  Just what I expected and wanted</review_text>
I ordered these shoes the minute I saw them featured on a fashion segment on the Los Angeles morning news. I have a new-found love for flats and the more comfortable, the better. I recieved them in the mail the other day and can't wait until it warms up a little so I can wear them (I'm in cold Chicago). They have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering, you could even dress them up. They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being.I ordered my true size, 7.5, and these feel almost perfect, maybe just a  little roomy, but I'm not going to bother exchanging them because I'm afraid a 7 may end up being too small. I haven't owned a pair of Keds since high school in the early 90s, nor have I tried any on since then because I was in denial of Keds being cool again, so I couldn't remember what size I used to wear -- but I'm very, very happy with these shoes overall</review_text>
This is the fifth pair of Club Cs I've owned, the second in black. I believe they're the best combination of durability and comfort on the market. I'll undoubtedly buy another pair when these wear out</review_text>
These are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck, to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. They're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet "breath" a little fresh air. Nice value for the price</review_text>
Love them.  They feel as comfortable as tennis shoes, and give the right support when doing a lot of walking, but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes</review_text>
Having sampled 100% cotton pinpoint shirts both on-line and from the stores themselves, my husband keeps returning to his favorite, the Land's End pinpoint.  Without a doubt, the quality is unsurpassed and its longevity is legendary! Now, when its time for new shirts, we don't think twice and go directly to Land's End and order.  They also have the widest color selection and each color is true to its picture and flattering to all</review_text>
All Aerosoles have that extra aaaahhh when you wear them, and these are no different.  I've worn them with skirts, slacks and jeans, my daughter (teen) liked them so much that she bought herself a pair.  I liked my black pair so much that I bought them in brown also</review_text>
Purchased this for my son. He loves wearing it (he's a big fan of ny and the pd). Fits well, washes well</review_text>
excellent product for the price  a lot cheaper than the bridal shop  fast shipping  thank</review_text>
I bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38.</review_text>
It's a little on the thin side for snowy or freezing weather, but great in keeping the chill off when you're out and about, or at the game. The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift</review_text>
Stylish and comfy... What more could you ask for?  My husband was very pleased</review_text>
My DH has worn Clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned. This new pair of Clarks, the Citadel Oxford, is his new favorite because it is light weight, casual, and so comfortable.</review_text>
WOW.. what can't I say about these shoes... I've bought two pair in different colors & absolutely LOVE them for their comfort and snazzy, fun appearance. They're great at work and at play, and even during outings that require alot of walking. Highly recommend!!</review_text>
GREAT price. I have another pair of these shoes I bought elsewhere at twice this price. Very comfortable. True to size.</review_text>
Reef makes the best sandals, the price is pretty much set, no real savings here, but the selection is great.  They may look like other sandals, but don't be fooled... They're TOP NOTCH</review_text>
These Crocs are very unique. They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it.I know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time. They are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes. I wear them when I am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside.In short, the Crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes. Treat your feet and buy them today</review_text>
Raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t-shirt. Good quality for the price.  I usually wear a medium but ordered the XL and it's a good fit (fitted but not too tight)</review_text>
Size was true. I just did not like the</review_text>
These boots look good with jeans. Can be loose, but comfortable with thick socks</review_text>
I love Birkenstocks and when I saw the Eaton Clog at such a low price, well, say no more.  Once you know your size, you can buy Birkenstocks from anywhere.  I just never expected to find them on amazon.com.  They're a little dressier style than my usual Bostons and I just love them</review_text>
I love my Birkenstock shoes.  They fill great.  I am a registered nurse. I am on my feet constantly all day.  These shoes are great for the support my feet need.  They are really comfortable. I will definately be purchasing more in the near future.</review_text>
This was inexpensive, attractive, excellent windbreaker. Only minor problem is a tiny bit too much fabric around the zippers so care must be taken to zip and unzip.</review_text>
I have received countless compliments on these rain boots. I love them, and I guarantee you will too! They are comfortable, stylish, and keep your feet dry in snow and rain. What a great purchase</review_text>
This item is great - study and well worth the money - light weight =- the only negative review would be with the company that I purchased from - they did not participate in the sale the site was running. Other than that - they filled the order fast and was pleased with the service and the quality of this briefcase</review_text>
I am very pleased with the soft briefcase I purchased.  It is so much easier to handle than a hard one.   I would purchase another item from the same manufactuer if I need something else</review_text>
Unfortunately I never received the product I purchased.  The company claimed that they sent via USPS and I never received it.  So as far as the company is concerned I am out of the money I spent, plus the product.  I have received no satisfaction</review_text>
These jeans are extremely soft and comfortable. Like most children's place merchandise the quality is nice and cut a little larger then other brands. My only negative thought is that the material should be a little thicker. My boys are tough on their clothes</review_text>
We loved this pair of sneakers for my 22 mo. old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we/he could keep using them. They are so easy to get on him, and we all know some are SO difficult. These slide right on while pulling the tongue. They are also wide enough for his "flinstone" feet, lol. They break in well for flexibility too.</review_text>
Skechers just seem to fit my feet well. Lucky me. These were inexpensive, solidly constructed, comfortable, and (at least in my eyes) stylish. What more could I ask for in a casual shoe</review_text>
I am very happy with this product, its comfortable and good looking. Worth buy...</review_text>
Stretchy, comfortable and made well- love this T-shirt! (Also its a slim fit and not really, really long like many are right now- more of upper hip length, which is great if you want to tuck it in!</review_text>
I had the worst feet!  I ran my first marathon in May, and I was in a panic.  On my long runs in March and the first part of April I was going to quit!  My feet hurt so bad!  I was training on a lot of downhill runs, and therefore landed on the balls of my feet.  Ouch!  I think I would have been better off to run in nothing, than to wear what I had, which was a top of the line shoe.  I was desparate!  I found these Asics GT 2110 Men's Shoe (I'm a woman) and I felt 100% better!! I had support plus the cushion I needed for my sore feet, what an awesome shoe!!  I finished my marathon in them, I couldn't have done it without them.</review_text>
There aren't many articles of clothing that allow people to support their favorite team, as well as appear smart and sexy at the same time. Red Sox hats, however, are just such an item. Go Sox</review_text>
This product is great. Their are a ton of different ways to use this bag. From rolling it to carrying it like a backpack. I would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other. It is great.</review_text>
these panties fit great wash after wash. great quality and very smooth under dress or pant</review_text>
The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.</review_text>
bought these several months ago at Ross Dress for Less in Oregon for $19.99 I love them I bought them in a off white since that was the only choice. Love the comfort of them, think the t-strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide & sloppy on my foot & the t-strap is cushioned so it doesn't hurt my wee toes, I wear a size 8-8 1/2 depending on the brand these say 39.5 don't know if that is correct sizing or not, I would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals, perfect for the beach or casual summer wear. I am a self-professed shoe addict & these are great for those days you want only comfort</review_text>
These are by far my favourite yoga pants. Very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're SUPER comfy. So stretchy that they feel like a second skin. And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T-shirt riding up. And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street!The biggest problem with these pants is that it's hard to want to wear anything else. I own some 4 pairs of these and LOVE them</review_text>
Most flattering yoga pants I've ever worn.  I have an akward figure, long waist, big butt, a little pot belly, but these pants look and feel great.  Plus, I've heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers.  I want 10 pairs</review_text>
This is one of the most comfortable shoes I ever owned.  Excellent quality and fit.</review_text>
these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look. they also are easy on the feet. i like the suede versions best personally, but when winter hits its best to have the leather</review_text>
These shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts, but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it.  The construction is very sturdy, and the pockets are a great bonus.  I loved the first pair so much that I bought a second pair</review_text>
I was very happy with my last order. It was easy to order and didn't take long to get the product. My grandson was a very happy little boy on christmas morning. Thank you so much for the great services.I will use amazon again and tell my friends about i</review_text>
My 6-yr. old is football nuts right now and he loves his jerseys!  Great product and very well made.  Can also be very versatile worn by itself in the summer and with a shirt underneath in the winter</review_text>
My son loves the jersey - a little pricey but a nice jerse</review_text>
I bought this shirt as a gift for my husband, he LOVES it.  It's comfortable, fits well and looks new after multiple washings.  Along with my husband being happy I am VERY pleased with the service of Amazon.com.  I ordered one item from shop.com it took 20 more days then what they told me it would arrive and when I got the watch it wasn't the watch that I ordered......they don't even sell the watch they were advertising.  To top it off their customer service was not good, when I called amazon's customer service they were very helpful and nice! Therefore you can understand how much I appreciated that the MULTIPLE items I ordered from Amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated, the products were all GREAT and the service was great!</review_text>
These look great with jeans, though I'm not a fan with skirts. I bought the black and now wish I could find the bronze in my size. I normally wear a 9, and depending on the brand I sometimes need a wide, but these I found the 8.5WW fits perfectly - go figure. Naturalizer runs very, very narrow. I love, love these shoes. I can dance all night without pain =) They are very cushioned, the top straps do not cut at all, and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2" heel. I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW!</review_text>
This is the first time I've ordered shoes without trying them on, but these shoes were exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in the department stores in my size.  I know the name Naturalizer so knew they would be good quality.  They fit perfect, and the price was right! Thank you Amazon</review_text>
This was a long over due replacement for the Dopp kit that was given to me when I left for Vietnam. Its changed very little and is still of fine quality. I expect it will provide all the use I'll ever need</review_text>
i am writing to u because i returned this item for exchange on size and print. what is the status of my exchange? thank u and hope to keep shopping your products, they are great</review_text>
This was a Christmas gift for my friend's husband. He really liked it and said it was excellent quality</review_text>
I was asked by my daughter to get these for Christmas. I got some for myself for my morning walks in -30C temps. They do not muss up my hair for the rest of the day, even when I have just gotten it done, and keep my ears toasty warm.  Great product and worth the money. My daughter is equally impressed.</review_text>
These work great - but its important to know that these are adjustable! It doesn't say so on the box, so when I first got them I thought they were way too small for adult heads and I was quite annoyed - however, you can adjust them once you put them on, just pull very slightly and they will adjust to make them fit perfectly</review_text>
they were slightly small and a tad too stiff.but very cut</review_text>
My husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing.  We love them.  I gave him two pair for Christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently...seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these.  They look great too</review_text>
after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i've ran across. i love it.</review_text>
I was very satisfied with my purchase and am in the process of ordering more hats</review_text>
The fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed. They wash beautifully and require little or no ironing. My husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well. The hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing.Frankly I wish I could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price Hagaar offers.Haagar has done a terrific job again</review_text>
I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles.About the same time as I purchased these boxers I purchased a couple pair of Faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material.  One pair of these ripped recently. My experience is the CK material is holding up better than the Facconable that costs twice as much.I doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others</review_text>
I have a wide, relatively short foot with a high arch and have lots of problems finding high quality dress shoes that fit.  Bostonians are the only quality shoes that fit me, so I have been loyal for the last decade.  I can't find them in my area, so Amazon is the only channel I use to get them</review_text>
You can kind of see through them, kind of not. The skirt is like a nifty mini, the G-string is not uncomfortable. This outfit looks good on my girlfriends, looks good on me and it'll look good on you too</review_text>
When I bought these shoes I didn't know they would look so pretty. I am glad I bought these shoes</review_text>
Purchased for our 6 ft 7 son and he is very pleased with them. They fit very comfortable and are long enough so that they do not come out of his belt line</review_text>
Russell!  I really wouldn't buy any other kind.  Too bad they don't make concert T-shirts!  Great material, long-lasting.  The best</review_text>
These are very pretty without too much fluff. The leather bottoms are padded which helps your feet especially if your home is on concrete slab. I love them</review_text>
This is the standard style from the new line of Performance jocks from Bike. This waistband is slightly smaller than the traditional 3 inch, but very comfortable. The pouch fits nice and snug giving you perfect support and the leg straps don't twist or bind. Easy to launder and pretty inexpensive. I got rid of my old worn-out jocks and bought a few of these new ones. They're masculine, modern and comfortable, but not something that would be embarassing putting on or taking off at the gym (like an orange or blue jock). A good buy.  Comes in a black version, that is also great.  I've worn for working out, and just around town - good for both.</review_text>
i'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them. i took them home, tried them on, and i was absolutely amazed. They are a bit of a low rise, but that only adds to the flattery. and i like my underwear that way. There are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to, and once you find the perfect fit, you can hardly even feel that it's there. I give it a perfect score, and i am definatley going to buy more of these</review_text>
Good quality for the great price.  Bought for my 10 year old son and should fit perfect.  Item was on backorder but still received in less than a week</review_text>
This item was as I expected as far as the description, it is the quality I expected and I am pleased with it.  However, I bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit (It fit the way I feared the 2-X would fit that's why I bought the 3-X).  Don't know if it was mis-sized or what</review_text>
I bought another of Clark's sandals a few years ago, which is why I ordered them again. These sandals were even more comfortable than the last pair! There was no break-in period with these shoes..I just put them on and spent the day in them without pressure points or blisters. I will buy more in other colors I'm sure. You can't go wrong with Clark's</review_text>
nice shoes, cut a bit high in the back so I got blisters at first- love the fabric and color-prompt shipping and nice bo</review_text>
This is a quality sweatshirt that I am enjoying wearing during the cold winter weather. I have had trouble, in the past , with other brands with the arms being too short or the body length being too short but that is not the case with this product . The only problem with the product is that it could stand to have more elastic at the bottom but this is a minor problem . The service was excellent and I will return for more BEARS gear</review_text>
the price for the bundle is the best part of the whole thing. [...] doesnt carry these products. they sell an adapter and then a usb cord. which is what apple does for their ipods and is a rip off for money.i like not having to worry with an annoying adapter when i want to charge my Zen. just plug in and walk away, not fiddle with the adapter to make sure it is inserted properly.the case is abit annoying. it catches lint like you wouldnt believe. but i'm not getting scratches and I HAVE A KICK STAND! i use that kick stand the most - its actually the main reason i bought this set.the bundle actually also arrived a few days before the Zen actually did, so it was sent FAST.i love this.get it</review_text>
I love these shoes...in fact I ordered another pair in black.  They are very comfortable and look cute.  Hey...can't beat that</review_text>
I was looking for an inexpensive but functional leather briefcase and this was exactly what I was looking for.  I have more than three electronic devices that I need easy access to - and the case has three outside pockets big enough to hold my devices.  The only thing missing is an outside place to put a pen or pencil.  I don't know how durable it will be, but I'm hoping, very!!For the price, this is a good buy</review_text>
What a great pair of pajamas these are.  So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging.  I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine</review_text>
I purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months. The shoes are very comfortable and look very professional. Love them.Strong and tough.Not to heavy. Has good grip on snow.</review_text>
These are without question, the best panties for wearing with slacks.  No line at the leg, no line accross the middle of your behind, and no riding up.  They are also cut low enough to not show in a moderately low rise pant.  Sizing runs true to any other Maidenform pantie you've ever bought. Can be had cheaper at a Maidenform outlet store, but still well worth the price on Amazon.  Buy lots of them</review_text>
Got this for my father.  He loves it.  Great coverage.  Easy to use</review_text>
Was shipped very promptly.Not the largest man's umbrella but well designed.Looks like someone really studied how umbrellas can wreck themselves by blowing inside out. So that this one won't</review_text>
Great pants. I bought these in a variety of colors and I am very satisfied</review_text>
My baby is large for her age and wears 6-9 month sized clothes even though she is only 3 months old.  I ordered two of these hats sized 6-12 months.  They are way too big for my baby but will probably fit her when she is actually 6 months. Hats are made of t-shirt fabric and look just like the picture. You do have to tie your own knot on the top. Andrew Christian sent each hat in a separate envelope and they arrived on different days, but within the shipping time specified</review_text>
The leather was good quality.  The wallet was well constructed.  I gave it as a gift and it turned out better than I it looked on the internet.  Grade A product</review_text>
Whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying!  I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V-neck shirt.  Just know that it really is deep!  I'm only in my twenties but I almost feel like an older man when I wear this shirt; cut lower than other V-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out!  If your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can't get any more comfortable than it already is!  Honestly, I probably won't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home, but I still love it</review_text>
It clearly says it is a MESH dress! I wore this for my wedding, outside in bright sunlight, and it certainly did not show everything, but do not expect it to be completely opaque, as it is a MESH dress with delicate lining.As for the quality, it wore well, and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design. Very fairy-like and pretty, and I was pleased to wear it</review_text>
These t-shirts fit on the small side, for women (not Juniors) but are soft, comfortable, and well made.  I have bought 4</review_text>
This is a great hard-side suitcase for the price.  It is basic and simple, but seems quite durable and functional.  I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not "TSA" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.I would buy this suitcase again</review_text>
great value! have always wanted a samsonite brand, but in brighter colors. i finally purchased the single upright suitcase(s)and fell in-love.i bought the pink and red. my kids and i will be vacationing over seas,and i wanted a better quality, more spacious luggage.this is perfect!the delivery turn-around time was impeccable! we'll be leaving in a few days to visit southeast asia. and we got our suitcases this early moning. continue the excellent customer-service</review_text>
Boots are warm & Cozy. However, the color was much lighter than pictured...not the end of the world. Also, the shipping took longer than expected</review_text>
I purchased these boots for my daughter.  I bought two pairs for her younger sister and she fell in love with the look.  She tried them on at a local sporting store and just loved how they hugged and felt on her feet.  I would buy all colors of the rainbow if she asked</review_text>
I used these Pajamas in the hospital after I delivered my baby and for the first 3 months of breast feeding.  You can wear them without a nursing bra since there is a way to to keep the nursing pads in. They are also very comfortable.  I wore them some days all day because they really don't look like pajamas.  I got them in blac</review_text>
Reliable brand of work pants in a good selection of colors is all we're asking for</review_text>
This is very comfy and pretty and a great price . Try it you will be sold. I am glad I did</review_text>
This product is really GREAT for this Sansa e260 I purchased. Strongly recommend it this Mp3 player. It helps grip, bottons work better, and looks "cool"</review_text>
I bought this sweatshirt last year and it is one of the most comfortable articles of clothing I own. I am a little ashamed to admit that I don't use it when exercising, its so comfortable I use it to lounge around the house.</review_text>
I purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding.  It arrived quickly, looked great, and was an awesome price.  It would be hard to beat this great deal</review_text>
I bought these to replace an identical pair that I've been wearing for ten years. I got the old ones in London, and they were made in England. This new pair was made in China.  They have changed...some for the good and some for the bad.  There is now more toe room, which I like. However, both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit. If you try to wear them too long when you first get them, they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet. Break them in slowly and you'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time.</review_text>
Good quality. Beautiful color. However had a side zipper which my husband didn't like as much as a top zipper</review_text>
These are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine, are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking.  It's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate.</review_text>
I own this halter top in black & white.  The colors are vibrant & the fabric quality is very good.  This style runs small, so order 1 size up for a comfy fit. This company's customer service rocks</review_text>
The shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning - you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress.  However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase</review_text>
my fav shoes- I can wear them to dress up or to dress down... the review about how to adjust the slasp was very helpful to</review_text>
I've been buying these sandals for 30 years.  I just love them</review_text>
Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin sox. I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's  wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room.  If they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and  smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now</review_text>
Great little case we have two. I like the inside pocket for extra memory/battery.</review_text>
this case is really nice and compact. there is a nice place for a card or x-tra batteries inside. is snuggly fits the HP digital camera. protects well. and well padded. very nice case</review_text>
This polo is absolutely fabulous! I love the length, it comes down to my hips. I bought it in the size I usually wear and it fits great! I wore it under a little khaki jacket with jeans and it looked fantastic. I can't wait to buy it in every color</review_text>
I love this Laptop Tote. It's big enough & ready to take to the pool</review_text>
I could not find these slippers in our local stores.  I had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item.  I ordered them, they arrived and I love them.  It was a very easy, customer friendly process</review_text>
nice shirt.  very hard to find in stores so it's worth the wait and the cash</review_text>
They are a great quality, comfortable boot. And the price was far less than local stores. The shipping at regular rate took over a week, though</review_text>
I purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of Ugg-like boots. We looked in stores and other online shoe sites for Uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season, couldn't find her size.  We saw these on Amazon in her size and thought we'd try them out.  They were definitely worth it!  They are just as warm and comfortable as Uggs and since the price was so good, we were able to buy two pairs.  They are nicely made, comfortable, and attractive. She's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable. She is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots</review_text>
I am enjoying the sneakers this Summer.  Comfy & perfect for elliptical trainer, stationery bike and weight room.  Very stylish, I love Skechers footwear</review_text>
IF OTHER UNDERWARE BINDS YOU, YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T. THE POUCH IS VERY LARGE, LOTS OF ROOM! I BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL DOZEN AND THREW ALL MY OTHER BRANDS AWAY</review_text>
Bought one, loved it, bought another one for my d-i-l, she loved it, bought one for my daughter, she loved it .....you're probably getting the picture now.  I bought the next size up for each of us, and it's wonderful with a shirt or light sweater underneath.  Oh, and did I mention the incredible price??</review_text>
This workout is short but you will feel "worked out" when done.  Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly.  No awkward transitions.  The ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio.  Your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves.  I enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells.  Definitely "shocked" the muscles</review_text>
As an advanced exerciser, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that. This workout comes with a sculpting ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! My arms really got a workout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonally across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the workout.Once we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squats, and lunges, we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.Tina leads, and she is very fit and quite personable. She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. As with all the new Firm releases, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercisers, with Allison showing beginner moves. Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusive.Beginners will enjoy this workout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.I have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good workout, but I wish it were longer. The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer.Overall, I give this workout high marks. It's definitely a keeper</review_text>
This is a VERY sexy pair of underwear. Guys: if you're new to the thong/g-string scene, this is a good place to start. I recommend g-strings because there's less coverage on the back which makes them more comfortable than thongs.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's pretty expensive but go ahead and splurge on one fancy pair of underwear. Your girlfriend will love it. Mine did</review_text>
This item was just what I was looking for.  I did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband's ties or a tie bar.  It is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving.</review_text>
Way beyond my expectations.  Exceptionally fine cotton, changes colors in the light, great fit, absolutely beautiful--great delivery.  Thanks so much</review_text>
The product was delivered in a timely manner and is a good quality product</review_text>
Great product, works well and was shipped promptly also there was an accurate product description....Thank</review_text>
I am thrilled to finally purchase Birkenstock at a price that is fair. Our local retail stores,mark them up, so ridiculously. Thank you, Amazon</review_text>
They are awesome, only tricky part is making sure you get the right size, my husband and I love them</review_text>
I am a product junkie and I never would have believed I could fit all my stuff in this bag, but I did!  This bag is amazing and takes up so much less space than the assorted bags I had been using!  I am getting one of these for each of my sisters..</review_text>
As the weather has cooled for fall and winter, I needed socks for my baby. I initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn't hold up as well. I have also tried socks with grips on the bottom, but they were so thick my son just sweated in them. The Children's Place socks are not too thick and very durable. Also, the non-slip  feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked. The other socks did not! I strongly recommend these socks for your child</review_text>
Before seeing it with my own eyes, I was a little skeptical of the huge buttons. After wearing it, I felt they were hardly noticable. I bought the brown version for $17.99 and I thought it was well worth it. This jacket is surprisingly wind resistant, ideal for cold weathers. The pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there</review_text>
I love this boot.  It's high, and the platform will make those unaccustomed a little teeter-y, but it's a great look.  The leather and detail on my pair is exceptional.  Green leather inside.  I really like these.  And I own 55 pairs of shoes/boots - know from whence I speak</review_text>
it was easy to order and very affordable and they were here quickly...I want to get more...thank</review_text>
it's comfortable and stays in place all day. it's wonderful not to keep adjusting straps all day. I am so glad I bought it, and it I got it delivered fast!</review_text>
I love this case. I purchased many cases before, but this offers the best protection at a very low price.Thanks. CoverCas</review_text>
I got this jacket when it was $50.  I was very impressed at the quality and i like how it's waterproof so i can just walk in the rain with it.  Great jacket and i think i will be wearing it for a long time</review_text>
The Lands End 60/40 Oxford is THE dress shirt to own!  It is the end of the line in your search for an excellent product!  I buy nothing but this shirt, and have multiple shirts in each color made.  I've worn a shirt and tie nearly every day since I was 16 years old in prep school (35 years now), and the Lands End is the best.  I highly recommend this shirt</review_text>
I've owned this coin pouch for several months now and it has held up exceptionally well to repeated use, proving to be an excellent and extremely durable holder for loose coins and eliminating the need to dig in one's pocket for spare change</review_text>
this is a nifty small appropiate change purse for men or anyone actuall</review_text>
Great cap.. quality is top notch.. Price is also great.</review_text>
i got and love it. however, someone else's product was shipped inside the box. it looked like the box came open and someone just grabbed whatever they thought came in the box. the product was not mine and the owners name and phone and address on it. I contacted them and sent it to them myself. it was suppliments for a very serioulsy ill small boy. I hope all that get things for others send it to them too! you never know whose life depends on it</review_text>
I bought this item for my boyfriend for his tailgaiting experience this year since he has season tickets.  He LOVES everything about it - especially the fact that it is the Bears!  =</review_text>
Better than just a beach tote, sturdy bag for any occasion, good price</review_text>
I'm very happy with this tote bag. It's huge and sturdy.I've been using it to bring books and files to and from school for marking. Quite a number of my colleagues like it, too</review_text>
I really love the way these shoes look.  I am really picky about shoes I buy.  I dont like to have my toe cracks showing when I wear shoes and I was afraid that these might do that.  They actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is.  I wore these shoes all night on new year's eve and had no problem.  I also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high.  I love these shoes so much a have 2 pair, black and red.</review_text>
I love the shoes, they're quite comfortable even though the heel is a little higher than what I like. They're a beautiful color, something you don't always see, and quite eye-catching.  And they just so happened to go very well with a suit I purchased months ago.As a "Nine West" Fantatic, thank you Amazon for having them available!</review_text>
I was shocked to see how high the heel was, and being in my 40s I wasn't sure if I wanted to find out how they felt.  But I had a company dinner party and wore them and was surprised at how "walkable" and comfortable they were.  I have worn them several times since then</review_text>
have spent years looking for a bra that feels good, does what it's supposed to and didn't make you wish you could get home & slip out of something so uncomfortable... at last i think i'm at the end of my search.  very comfortable, great support and can go hours before i start thinking about jammies.  only thing that would make this bra better would be padded straps</review_text>
I brought a couple pair of these to our little lingerie party, because I knew the girls would like them. I've been wearing them for over a year and I like them a lot. My husband does too. They look good, turn him on, turn me on too. You can't ask for more than that in a panty, now can you</review_text>
My husband liked his slippers I got him for Christmas.  He said that they were warm and soft</review_text>
This bag is great!  Very fashionable and protective of my laptop.  Great side pockets and convenient pocket for cell phones</review_text>
I absolutely love this case! The cool thing about it is that it doesn't look like a regular laptop case (i.e. the bulky, usually black, boring, case). My best friend didn't even know it was a laptop case and fell in love with the bag itself! It makes a great gift for any soon-to-be college student</review_text>
Been purchased many pairs Keds shoes,very stylest and comfortable.Me and my mom love them</review_text>
The webbing was abundant and easy to cut to my needed length. These belts can be made to fit anyone</review_text>
This is a very nice leather bag.  It has two pockets in the front that the flap goes over.  The pockets do not close and I have found that you can lose things out of those pockets even with the flap closed.  That is the only problem I can see with this bag</review_text>
Love the shirt!  This was a birthday present for my son.  We are so impressed with the quality that we will definitely use this Amazon site again</review_text>
These are great socks.  In the description it mentions that they fit sock sizes 10-13.  I assume that is the same as shoe size, but it is not explained.  This, however, is an important point, since I wear a size 10 shoe.  I can wear the socks and I really like them but I wish they were a little smaller.  One size does not fit all.</review_text>
Columbia sport sandals for kids are great! We've bought them three years in a row now for our kids.They hold up well, are comfy, and the colors are great.  Easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze.They're well constructed, but the dirt starts to show on the nylon parts after a while. They won't really wear out before your kids feet grow to the next size</review_text>
I love these shoes! They are so comfy and cute and Keds is my favorite brand of shoes</review_text>
This product is fine, however it was much too baggy.  I'm not that skinny and I felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with the short, but I just wish I had bought a smaller size.  Definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product.</review_text>
I have been trying to find low heeled sandals with a back strap and no thing between the toes so I was very excited to find these. I bought 4 pairs (silver, bronze, black, and turquoise). They are beautiful and comfortable (I walked around at Disneyland in the turquoise ones from 9am to midnight!) The sizing was very true and the standard shipping was very fast. I highly recommend both these sandals and Amazon.com</review_text>
I purchased the scarlett version of this bag more than two years ago, and it's still in perfect condition!  The color doesn't fade when you wash it, and it's the most durable bag I've ever owned.  I will not, refuse to, absolutely cannot make me carry a purse, but I carry this bag everyday.  The very front zipper pocket is great for change, the small zipper holds my keys and cell and a host of other small items I always seemed to be losing before, and the large pocket is big enough to fit several medium sized paperbacks in.  It's perfect for everyday use, and will last forever. The "backpack straps" are comfortable and have never broken.  I was so excited when I found this on Amazon, and IN EVERY COLOR!  Before, the selection was red and black only, so this is fabulous!  Buy this bag, you will love it</review_text>
Very quick delivery.  Price was very good compared to other online companies.  Will use again</review_text>
This bra is very comfy and also quite sexy for a sports bra!  I am a b cup and am using it for low to moderate impact activities and have found it quite supportive and comfortable</review_text>
I purchased these slippers in pink, and not only are they super cute, they are quite comfortable and very warm.  The sole of the slipper is slightly heavier than most, but it is nice if you need to step outside or in the garage for something when it's cold out. I would recommend them. :</review_text>
These are stylish and nice and perfect to wear under a pair of cutoff Levi's. My cutoffs are so faded, so frayed, so, well you know. So when I peal them off to reveal this Butterfly Lace up Panty (in Black with the pick laces on the back) it's like an instant transformation from outdoor girl to bedroom girl. We only had two colors at our lingerie party, white and the black and pink models, but I can imagine all the colors would be nice too.</review_text>
Amazon notes that these socks are "only made from the finest yarns." They mean it, too! These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves.The socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12; therefore it is almost one size fits all. A big plus! I also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers. Great!I would not dry these socks at high temperatures. This could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot. Eventually they will "bunch up" when you wear them and that's very uncomfortable. Dry these fine socks at a lower temperature.Overall, you can't go wrong buying these socks. They keep your feet extra warm during colder weather. They are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money's worth. A good deal!SMILE</review_text>
They looks nice, and fit really well, however, not so soft like some other Clarks/Indigo.</review_text>
Fits, Great quality,great sale price- If your lucky you don't get what you pay for</review_text>
I ordered these robes (in white and ivory) as Christmas gifts for my mother and father-in-law.  They arrived quickly and beautifully packaged.Last week, I was told that they loved their thick and luxurious robes - they feel as if they are at a spa.  I was concerned about the one size fits all sizing, but I was told that she loved the extra coverage (she's probably a size 14-16) and this is one of the few robes that goes around his expanding waistline (I buy him XL sweaters).I will order one for myself as soon as I am in the market for a robe.</review_text>
The robe is very warm and heavy, perfect for cold mornings and the "just out of the shower chills" that you get. It doesnt quite have the "luxurious" feel of a spa robe, and the thread loops are matted in certain areas, but quality wise it is better than anything else I've seen for similar prices. The length is much shorter than pictured. I bought this for my boyfriend, who is 6 ft, 190 lbs, average build, and it comes just above his knee! All in all, it's a decent robe for the price and he likes it.</review_text>
El producto lo recibi en perfectas condiciones, excelente comprarle a ustedes.-saludosMaryury</review_text>
The sneakers are great.  My son loves the wheels on the side</review_text>
this has to be the best beanie that i have ever purchased...i wear it all the time, it fits perfectly and looks awesome!</review_text>
I have ordered this tux for my 18 months old son for my sister's wedding. It looked amazing!!!The suit arrived timely and I couldn't believe how perfect they have prepared the whole package. All the details were well thought and the tux looked perfect with satin buttons, matching waist band and stripes on the side of the pants. Even the shirt is so well tailored.My son was very comfortable in the suit during the whole night and accepted more applouds than the groom!I sincerely recommend this product</review_text>
My husband bought me these for Christmas and I have had more compliments on these!! The flare styling and laces set them off</review_text>
Great product--just what I was looking for.  Service was excellent and shipping was prompt.  Thank you, thank you, thank you</review_text>
I love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that I have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight.  I would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured</review_text>
My wife had one just like this for 15 years and it was time for a new one. This back is almost identical and better quality. Shipping was very fast and it came exactly as I expected</review_text>
I actually purchased the Silicone skin case and detachable belt clip as a gift for my boyfiend. He loves and it was much cheaper than the one Creative offers on their website.</review_text>
I LOVE these shoes!!!!!they are so comfortable and you can buy them for a great price.i have them in gold and im really happy with my purchase</review_text>
Agree 100%, very comfy. Besides making the ideal for everyday use, the fabric is so soft that is very hot to the touch. The look is very sexy. So they are good in both sides: comfy and sexy</review_text>
For the price it's a nice dress.  Check your size carefully.  I'm normally a 29 waist in jeans, usually size 6, sometimes an 8.  I ordered a Large and it fits with only a little room, but a Medium would have been too small.  Slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than I expected it to.</review_text>
Birkenstock clogs are the comfiest shoes. During a recent trip to Washington DC, I was the only person in my group whose feet didn't hurt after several hours of walking. I have had several pairs over the years. They last forever and go with tons of different outfits</review_text>
I'm a pretty sexy girl and these so called panties are just about too sexy for me. Ooooweee do I feel hot when I have 'em on. Levi's, shorts, dress or trucker's overhauls, it makes no difference. The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there, but you'll know and that's enough to add a certain blush to your face, let me tell you. They made me feel ready for bed all day long</review_text>
Great purchase -- good price, easy.  what more could you want</review_text>
These are my new favorite boots!  The detailing on them is gorgeous and although they are quite high heels, they have a bit of a platform so I do not feel wobbly at all on them.  I'm really happy with my purchase</review_text>
I like this dress. I am medium sized and bought size Medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown, with even a little extra. I think even if I would of get size Small it would still fit well with more "trim fit" look. It is basically like a super long tank with body contour. Nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on, but also want to look good in it. (It is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend's long tea-shirt, if you understand what I am saying). It is soft, comfortable, cozy, beautiful color. I am very pleased with this product.</review_text>
Was delivered quickly, was priced right, and folded up into a small size so I could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation.  When unfolded it held more than the suitcase.  High quality material and excellent workmanship.  I think I'll buy another one for a spare</review_text>
this is a great wallet! it fits into small purses. the purpose of this is just to hold a few cards, your id and a small zipper section for some money. it's not meant to be a complete, big wallet. i love it because it fits into my small purses and so easy to carry around. i don't have to shove and push my bigger wallets into my purse and not have room for anything else anymore. love it!</review_text>
All my Gold Toe socks are excellent, but these offer extra room and are extremely comfortable, especially after the first washing. I am about to buy another pair! The Trellis style is the other wonderful Gold Toe sock for comfort</review_text>
Absolute gems.  Simple, versatile shoes that are fun, comfortable, and have great casual style.  I have them in red, wear them to work, when traveling, and the one time I got stuck in a surprise Seattle snowstorm, they even had traction.  Nearly an all-purpose shoe.</review_text>
My wife shopped around at Amazon looking for her grandmother's 88th b-day (coming up soon) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf.  Every silk scarf she came across she would say, "What a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are."  Before she found Vietmade Silk Scarfs at Amazon, she had looked online stores at Macy's, Nordstorm, JcPennies, but couldn't really compare with the ones Vietmade made.  I agree with my wife when she said, "This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices!!"  When we got the scarf today 4/10/07 (ordered 4/4/07) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself, one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law.  My wife and I definately recommend this place and we'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future.  Also, delivery was on schedule, good packaging and love the scarfs!</review_text>
I was looking for a wrap to go with a black backless dress. This scarf was perfect. It added just enough color with a little sparkle and was plenty large to use as a wrap. Very pretty</review_text>
Great jacket, excellent feel. only qualms are the quality of the zipper and the big bright label on the inside of the jacket. 5 stars for the leather itself, soft and very comfortable. change the zipper so that it doesnt jam on the way up 99% of the time, and make the label much more subtle and this would be an awesome jacket!also sad but not surprised to see this is made in chin</review_text>
I'm shocked I forgot to write a review about these jeans. I love these jeans. They are by far my favorite jeans. The fit is perfect and allows for room to breathe. I love wearing these jeans with my boots on a daily basis. I can't say enough about them. I tell everyone about them. Even for a petite woman the fit is far better than anything I could find in a local store. I am completely satisfied. They also have a very modern look to them</review_text>
I buy these wherever I can find them.  It's a bit of a tribute to my aunt, for her middle name, but wish I could find them more frequently.</review_text>
This product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim (so many types of luggage are similar in style and color, we've had trouble in the past).  Several of our family members were given new luggage for Christmas and these tags were included. These tags are big, bright lime green and can be easily seen. No more headaches in trying to find our luggage.</review_text>
The product arrived in a reasonable time frame and was what I had ordered.  I really like it</review_text>
I love these shoes! The service was great, the price great! These are really good shoes. I have a hard time finding wide shoes where I live. These were perfect! Very comfortable, very good quality. This is where I will be buying my shoes</review_text>
on time delivery - would have been nice to have a gift wrap optio</review_text>
I found it very comfortable with good fitting. I bought 4 pairs in last 3 and half years and this one was the best. I gave it 5 stars based on comparing with other brands that I bought. Overall quality is good.</review_text>
Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down.After getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.The particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleevesThe outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose.Once the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.The first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.Bottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.</review_text>
These shoes are so comfortable and cute! I've gotten a lot of compliments on them, and I like their old-school Pony look</review_text>
I mailed this for a shower gift so I didn't see the item but was told it was very cute</review_text>
This brown leather wallet does not have a highly glossy finish as shown in the image; leather is well-stitched but thin. Old-fashioned style with no credit card slots. Snaps and zipper handle add bulk to profile; not a front pocket wallet for sure. Purchased two as gifts for nephews, will probably get one for myself.</review_text>
These shirts are hard to find during certain seasons.  I was very happy to find that Amazon had them.  The quality of these shirts have lasted a long time.  The fit is perfect and comfortable</review_text>
I am very happy with the above purchase.I am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item. I like it because it fits well and when you wear it, you feel quite cool. Will shop agai</review_text>
These were purchased for a wedding.  The quality is very good.  We would like to see solid black offered and argyle in black,pink, grey, and white.Thank you,Joy Ree</review_text>
These shoes are beautiful and comfortable.  I wore them at a New Year's Eve wedding... danced all night with NO sore feet!  This is my third pair of Carlos shoes, LOVE THEM</review_text>
I initially bought these shoes for my mom for a Christmas gift, but she said they were too high for her. Well i fixed that, I kept them for myself.  :)I love them and they are really hot!ThnxJa</review_text>
My  only reason for not giving it a 5 star is because there i no elasticated bottom cuffOtherwise Great Gym Pant</review_text>
I was a little nervous about ordering clothing from the internet.  Not knowing if it would fit.  I think that the sizing chart used for this particular product works well because the produt turned out to fit just right.  Also, the picture is on key with the actual product.  My loved it and so do I</review_text>
This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount.  Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though</review_text>
What a great pair of pajamas these are.  So soft, non-binding, roomy, and great for lounging.  I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine</review_text>
I love these shoes and so does everyone who sees me in them.  I am the envy of the girls at work</review_text>
I actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9.  The 9 didn't fit well the arch was too short, so I sent them back and kept the 9.5.  They are very nice, I've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years.  I get a lot of compliments, from people of all ages (20-65).  Not too young looking, not too old looking.  They are the perfect boot.  One little negative....I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion.  After that I can wear them all day long.  I should have ordered them in brown!!</review_text>
These sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and I just bought another one in a different color.  They feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed Napoletana designer, Ermenegildo Zegna.But, as a general rule when buying Italian clothing, *always* buy them bigger than you would expect.  I normally wear a size large shirt in the US, never XL.  I am 5'7" and 185 lbs.  I bought a size 54 (x-large) and it is comfortably roomy, and not too "huggy" on the fat.   I think some of the similar sweaters from Zegna are more "delicate" (read: see-through).  This one is a little thicker, but still thin for a sweater.  I *really* like wearing it with a t-shirt underneath, feeling the soft cashmere on your arms.</review_text>
We are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season.Unfortunately, the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from Amazon after sending 4 emails.  We do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching.  We have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company, but we can not get anyone to respond.  We will never order anything through Amazon again</review_text>
The gazebo is very sturdy and works great in the sun and rain.  Adding the team cover is a great way to show your team pride during tailgate parties!  It takes a bit of practice to set up the unit but I believe that all gazebos have the same problem.</review_text>
Love it...Love it...Love it!!! Every football fan should have one. It is perfect for tailgating. This is the only site I could find it. Great price and the free shipping is a great deal. It also shipped really fast, faster then it had originally said.</review_text>
I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He's been wearing it a lot.  He says it's comfortable, and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out.  I was hoping it has more of a dressier look.  It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki's</review_text>
The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well! The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful.</review_text>
Good material and does the job that it promises!! All other brands claim to do the same thing but "not all glitters are gold" :</review_text>
great shirt for working out in. Clears away all the sweat and is loose fitting</review_text>
I have worn nothing but levi's for over 20 years now, and I have been through almost every style of them.  These are still the same great jeans, reliable fit and quality that you know.  Currently I have three of these in my closet nest to standard 505's, and they are virtually identical, but the signiture series cost a lot less. Same thick denim material, unlike a lot of fancy boutique jeans, that last a long time, and can stand up to most activities that an active person does.  Check these out, you won't be dissapointed, and neither will your wallet</review_text>
I got this hat because it reminded me of what Jack Nicholson wore in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I'm happy to say it also keeps my head quite warm. Cashmere is very soft and it breathes well (my head never feels too hot)</review_text>
I've tried 6 different nursing bras. This one, with the center snap closure, is the easiest to use. It is also the lightest and most comfortable, while providing good support. My only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric. Even when I try to sew it back into place, it breaks loose after a few washes. Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine, it would last longer. This bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras (particularly the Leading Lady bra, which seems to be indestructible), but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort, lightness, and ease of use. It is by far my favorite</review_text>
A great shoe! I was very impressed with the softeness of the leather, immediate comfort and versatility of this shoe. This is definitely a well made, year 'round slide. If you are looking for a classic loafer; this is your shoe.</review_text>
the shawl was beauiful and just the right color. an excellent value too.very good product fast shippin</review_text>
I love these pajamas. The color, the softness (get softer the more you wash),and the fit. I had purchased these for an older friend and found I wasn't able to part with them so I made it up to her in other ways. Never done that before...shows how much I like 'em.</review_text>
Arrived fast and in time for V-day! Thanks for your high quality product and its fast arrival</review_text>
I love these pants!!!! i'm a first time Boarder and I wasn't cold at all!!! Deffinately a Great BUY</review_text>
i tried these on and i'll never wear boxers again!They are very confortable and i sleep in them everynight.they are tight, but not too tight. I wear these to schoolas well! I love them</review_text>
It's a very nice polo, very soft and nice to a casual date</review_text>
I bought Brown Burnished color of this variety. After I got them, I tried them on and these are, simply, fantastic. I liked the way they fit onto my feet. My feet are wide and hence I had ordered a wider version of these. They give you a very comfortable and stable feel when you have them on and walk around. The sole looks very sturdy and durable. Does not skid over wet surfaces</review_text>
The robe arrive in great condition and in a timely manner. My boyfriend absolutely loved his Christmas gift! Thanks again! :-</review_text>
It's thin, so you can wear something over it.  And it helps keep the chill out.I wear it cycling and golfing</review_text>
Since these jeans were ordered as a gift for someonelse, I cannot give my own opinion of the jeans, other than to say I received the jeans in a timely manner and that the size and color was exactly what I had ordered</review_text>
The wallet was a gift for my daughter's boyfriend.  He loved the wallet, the leather, the design, style, and sleek look of the Fossil wallet. It was a great purchase and a good value</review_text>
this is a form fitting, but not to snug nightshirt. gives freedom of movement, yet also allows some comfort with a nice breathable material. deffinitly will order more of thes</review_text>
I hate long socks and smelly shoes so I've become a big fan of shoe liners.  I recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them.  They are each individually priced at $5.99.  So for 6 pairs you'd pay $36 retail.  So this is a good deal at $4/pair.More importantly, they are heavy-weight cotton with no underside seam.  They have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet.  They are cut generously -- My feet are about size 8 and they are a little big, but manageable.  If you have smaller feet I'd try to get a different size than M/L.  They do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers, but a lower cut shoe could be problematic.I've tried a lot of these socks:  Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Peds, Leggs, et al.  These are by far the best.</review_text>
I bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them. These are some great looking shoes.</review_text>
This is a great idea that is not apriciated until you go on a long trip and end up with dirty wrinkled clothes that are all thrown into a bag. This keeps clothes seperated and organized and easy to repack if you are moving from place to place</review_text>
Great grip, cool rugged look, comfortable enough for regular winter use as well. Was about $80 when I got it though. Might not be the best option around for $130</review_text>
My online shoe shopping tip: Buy a half size bigger than your normal size.If it's a little too big, you can always add inserts to achieve a betterfit.  I also search the web for additional consumer reviews.PROS:This pointy toed boot looks really sexy - A great bargain for 30 bucks!It's an easy to put on short boot.(It goes up to the bottom of my calf - I'm 5'5)The leather is shiney and has a seamless look.Stains will wipe right off.I'd recommend these with a nice pair of jeans or even for youngprofessionals to wear with their slacks.Relatively comfortable.  I personally wouldn't wear them all day long.CONS:Leather IS stiff.  Doesn't really bend with the leg when walking.I think that is what the previous negative review was referring to.The inside of the shoe has a nicer softer leather.The zipper is not the best quality.Hope this helps you make a better shopping decision!* Or, you can always buy, try on and return.If you choose the free shipping method and you want to return the item,you just have to go to the Returns section of the website andgenerate a return label.  Once Amazon receives it and processes it,they will give you your refund MINUS the shipping cost you savedwhen selecting "Free Shipping".(It is usually less than 5 bucks and you can see the amount in "Your Account)enjoy</review_text>
Great company to order from... good product and got to me faster than any other order</review_text>
I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding "it all" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet</review_text>
I love my Cayman Crocs. My sister swore by these shoes, but I wasn't convinced because they are a little different looking. I liked the bright colors I saw some people wearing at the beach this summer, but I'm practical and they can only go with so many things.I ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything. I'm not at all disappointed. They really don't look bad paired with casual outfits.I wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it's amazing. It's not so much that you slip them on and say "wow this feels great" ... for me it was more so that after activities (marathon shopping trips for example) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit. I think they are great ... even with the "different" look ... though I do wish they'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point</review_text>
Spectacular item.  Wears well on a fine woman.  My wife is short, and this item fit fine, especially since most one-size-fits-all lingerie is built too tall</review_text>
Thank you for this Great Gift for a baby shower States away that you made helpful and she loves i</review_text>
These go on real easy, and come off real easy.  They feel like a regular cotton sock except that they wick sweat away.  I'm ordering more</review_text>
I searched the Internet for a particular type of sock that my son likes, but discovered they were no longer manufactured.  So I went to Amazon to see what they offered and decided to try the Gold Toe.  The price was excellent and my son likes them very much.  (He's very finicky about some things and it was a real "if" to try something new)... I'm so happy that Amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they didn't work out.  My son has looked at the price of this sock at some of the department stores nearby & discovered that the Amazon price is very good; so now we know where to go when he needs some more.  Thank you, Amazon</review_text>
The shorts were everything I wanted. The service was 5 star and my husband wears these short all the time. I bought him all the colours available</review_text>
My child slept with these shoes on the first night he got it.  I allowed it because he has not worn it outside.  Of course, he wore it the following day to school, rode his bike with it and just took it off at the end of the day.Very comfortable and cute shoes.  I might get a pair for myself</review_text>
I own 2 pairs ...They are classy and go with everything,but the only minus point is that they are a bit heavy...but you eventually get the hang of it</review_text>
These shoes exceeded my expectations, in that they are very lightweight.  The soles are made of some kind of stiff foam instead of solid rubber.  Time will tell how it wears compared to rubber, but the shoes are noticeably lighter than the last pair I owned.   They look good, they are very comfortable--very little, if any, break-in time.  If you like the look, it's a safe buy--you won't be disappointed with the build and feel</review_text>
So far I have been very satisfied with this bag. For the price I really can't complain. It has enough different sections, places for pens, a divider, pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use.I'm curious about the durability; how the leather will hold up and if the zippers will last.I use it to hold 2 1" notebooks, a textbook, a portfolio, a book, a calculator and my pda. This is about maximum capacity. I should note that the notebooks and portfolio just do fit inside the sections.The handle ontop is cozy, the over the shoulder strap should be wider.Overall, I am happy with the purchase, and hope that it lasts</review_text>
My son used these socks as part of his football uniform.  He said they were comfortable and I was happy that they withstood the abuse week after week.  The didn't run or snag like some other lighter weight socks</review_text>
This shirt is very cute, but you may want to order it in a larger size than what your child normally would wear. My child normally wears a 24 month. I ordered the size 2, and it's much tighter and shorter than her other tops</review_text>
shirts are what I had expected and the service was grea</review_text>
I am very pleased with these shoes. They are very comfortable and look great as well.</review_text>
It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning!  All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart.  I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.I bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.  It "flows" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe.  And the silk lining makes me feel "rich"!Overall, I like it</review_text>
The wand is sturdy, full-sized and nicely designed, even if made of plastic.  The kids wanted their wands so they could play "Harry Potter", so this was much more appropriate than the beautiful but more fragile and very expensive collectors versions available</review_text>
This is cute, funny, and it's not uncomforable! I think it rocks! I love this movie...I even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth</review_text>
The overall quality of the garment is excellent.  The fabric is of very good quality, as is the stitching.  The sizing is also accurate.  However, the tank top I received was NOT the one I had ordered, but a substitute!  Thus, four stars, not 5.  In the future I will specify that a substitution will not be acceptable</review_text>
These SOX are the BEST my husband has ever used. He has asked for me to buy more and he has thrown all his other over the calf sox into the trash. He has been in construction for almost 30 yrs and has never been happy w/any sox I have found for him until now. These make him VERY HAPPY!! Thank You</review_text>
My husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots.  I also like the fact you can buy them in black and Amazon had a fantastic price on them.  I don't know the wearability of the socks since I just got them for my husband for Christmas.  I bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay - no holes in the toes, yet!  Overall, I think the socks are great.</review_text>
These socks are really comfortable and they really stay up! All other brands of over-the-calf socks that I have tried won't stay over-the calf. Within a few hours, other socks are sitting on my shins. I have worn pairs of the Gold Toe Over the Calf Athletic Sock for up to 24 hours and the most they slid down my leg was about an inch. Great socks</review_text>
This is absolutely the most comfortable and flattering bra I have even owned.  Have thrown out all my regular bras and only wear this one now.  The fit is unbelievable</review_text>
This sandle is very comfortable and attractive.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle</review_text>
Birkenstocks are a great thing for my diabetic feet.  I found this particular model to be a bit narrow to my liking</review_text>
This little scale can pay for itself many times over, and grants peace of mind as you approach check in.  I purchased two, one for my Australian friend who always overpacks and has to pay at the gate for overweight luggage.  It is more accurate than bathroom scales.  If you are by yourself, hold it in front of a mirror.</review_text>
Was shopping at the mall.  This item caught my husband's eye in the window.  We went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it's uses.  We actually bought one for ourselves.  It came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland (going and returning home).  Especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight.  I was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn't.We foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages.  It's a two-man operation.  My husband would lift the luggage/bag, then I would look at the scale quickly</review_text>
I tried this shoe at Shoe Carnival today. It was on sale for $49.99. Needless to say, I bought it right away at Amazon since it was $39.99! It fit me really well, I walked around the store and the strap stayed fastened, it was comfortable all around. I really like the mesh material at the toe area. I'm hoping this would mean that my toes will be well ventilated during warmer summer months! This is a very comfortable trendy shoe that is a good option for those wanting to look hip while wearing something comfortable to include more walking steps in their work day. It's also a great shoe for those not wanting to expose their toes wearing sandals but want them to breathe.</review_text>
The item was what I expected however, It took them weeks to have the item shipped. I sent over emails to follow up and they never responded. Bad customer service.</review_text>
We needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids and started with those super stiff plastic ones from Babies R Us.  The stiff bibs were great for keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off of her high chair.  We've got a Svan high chair (the best!) that has a pretty small opening for the kid's torso, so a stiff bib that you are constantly stuffing in there is such a pain.  Also, when cleaning, if you got the back (fabric) side of the bib wet, the bib would be cold and wet for hours.  The bumkins bibs can be washed thorougly with soap and water in the sink and then hung up.  They will be totally dry by the next meal!  They are so soft that our daugher doesn't mind wearing them.  They do not get in the way and stay nicely tucked (assuming our daughter doesn't pull the bib up to look for "bib goodies" in the pocket).  We bought 2 sets and could easily use more.  They can also be washed in the washing machine (no dryer but they air dry super fast)</review_text>
See my review for the Desert Digital.  I own both the woodland and the desert BDU's</review_text>
Bra was more padded than I thought when ordering.  Descriptions of products are not adequate.thanks, though...love shopping on Amazo</review_text>
This bra fits, is comfortable, and invisible under T-shirts. I hope they keep making it forever</review_text>
This bra is great for those of us with smaller busts.  It's the only bra I'll wear under my t-shirts now because it doesn't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra I've found.  It VERY comfortable.  The only downside is that mine did lose it's form (it's not as tight fitting as it used to be) a little bit faster than some other bras.  But, it's absolutely worth buying a replacement.  I just hope they never stop making this bra</review_text>
This is a nice case if you are looking for something compact.  I have a Kodak Easy Share digital camera and it fits perfect inside.  The case has a nice size front pouch and 2 side pouches for easy storage</review_text>
I purchased 2 other bags before finding this one.  It is awesome.  The Canon S2 IS is a hard camera to find a case for that isn't way too tight or super big.  I wanted a bag for my camera and the original accessories that came with it.  This bag fits it all perfectly!!  It isn't too small or too big.  The camera fits perfectly without squishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the usb cord or whatever else you want to put in there.  I wouldn't recomend this bag if you are looking for a bag to hold additional lenses is, it isn't big enough for that</review_text>
My son loves the backback and the spacious room for he has for all the engineering books he needs for class</review_text>
This is the best style and fit of underwear that I have ever owned. I have been buying this style for almost 7 years now. It gives me the support and freedom that I need in physical activity and the comfort I desire in everyday wear. Plus, it provides you with a nice lift and profile.Note, beware ordering through Freshpair. My order took 1 month from them</review_text>
I love it. It is just what I wanted. Great deal and smooth transaction. Thanks</review_text>
I was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years, yet wasn't going to take years to pay for!  (HA! HA!)  This is a nice checkbook cover for the money.  My only complaint is that it needs to have a "tab" to keep your check register open to the page you are working on.  However, it does have a "loop" to keep a pen inside, you should desire to do so.  All in all, a good buy</review_text>
Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions.  It is stable, comfortable, provides good traction, and is warm without being sweaty. I would strongly recommend this boot.</review_text>
speedy delivery  product  as  stated   would buy from them agai</review_text>
Best sock in performance that I have ever tried.  I buy them in bulk and have never been dissappointed.  No sagging, no defects.  The only reason I toss them is that they fade to gray after a long life of use.One of the few products that once you try them you never have to worry about this item in your wardrobe again.  If they ever stopped making them, I would buy a 100 pairs just to know I would have them for my liftime.There...I actually wrote a review on socks!</review_text>
I bought this product online about a week ago and it is exactly as described.And to the reviewer who backpacks: If your that hardcore of a backpacker, you might want to consider spending more than $6 on a fanny pack. Seriously, lighten up and review the product, not tell your life story</review_text>
This shoe transcended all my expectations...the style, color, and fit were all everything I hoped for and more!!!  All this plus a modest price!!</review_text>
This shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt.  It is unlined, has a bit of stretch for comfort, and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts. I think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen. I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter, and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt. It was almost thirteen dollars then, but I have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal</review_text>
I have owned a pair of these boots for three years now and they are still going strong. I work in construction and find these to comfortable boots whether I am on site, at home, out on the town, etc. These are really incredibly made considering their 40 dollar price tag</review_text>
These are just what I was looking for in a knee sock.. Perfect weight and never slip but aren't too tight at the top either</review_text>
My daughter's school requires that they where white knee highs with their uniform.  I had an awful time searching the net to find any until I came across these.  They are very soft and comfortable.  My daughter only wants these types of socks from now on.  But from a Mom's point of view they are hard to keep white.  Even with soaking in bleach I can't get out any of the foot wear and tear discoloring.  Other than that, they're great</review_text>
These socks are wonderful.  Just the right weight, very comfortable and warm.Don't fade after washing, etc. etc.   I purchased 6 pair two months ago and have purchased 6 more</review_text>
I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had. It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second. I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer. I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon.</review_text>
The belt is high qualilty and was a good value for the price.  Very satisfied</review_text>
I where these shoes all the time. They are really comfortable to run in</review_text>
I like the look of the shoes and the shiny parts are easy to clean, although the cloth parts are difficult to keep clean. I have a high arch and they seem to support well so I would say over all they were a good choice</review_text>
Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money.  I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price.  Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less! For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don't want to send $90.00 and up for Shox</review_text>
I was concerned that these silk PJ's would be really thin and on the cheap side. But to my surprise, they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them.  I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them. Plus the fit was perfect.  I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size...and another person said the opposite.  (That confused me when I went to buy.) So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect!  :)  My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ's ever.The size is perfect, color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings. Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past.  I can't find anything I don't like about these.I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out. lol  Anyone thinking of buying these I can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least.Ja</review_text>
I've had foot problems this past year. Shoes that I had worn comfortably for years, including other Rockports, Ecco, New Balance, Avia, Reebock, Asics, etc..., were suddenly uncomfortable and painful to wear all day long.These Rockports are great. I'm finally NOT in a hurry to get home and get into my slides. I was to the point that I'd pay $300 or better for a comfortable pair of shoes. This shoe is well worth the money</review_text>
I highly recomend Fruit of the Loom mens briefs. Not only I did grow up wearing their brand, but my father and his father before him all wore these briefs. If somethings not broke why fix it</review_text>
Backpack is light when empty, yet strong to curry the load of books to school. Side pocket for bottle very handy. Top pocket for CD player or small easy to reach items such as keys, very helpful and practical. I like the base of the backpack being dark color so  it doesn't look dirty from use</review_text>
I love these bras so much! They are so comfortable, any other bra I wear now feels weird. The only thing i noticed was the lacy edging started bubbling after about two months of washing and drying, otherwise their my very favorite bras</review_text>
I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items I ordered -- as well as receiving a 10% discount coupon for my next order. Thanks</review_text>
This tee-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before.  I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt.  On the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in "hand" is worth the added function of "wicking" in this instance.  Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it.</review_text>
This is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you're dressed in a short sleeve over this one.  However, I personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company.</review_text>
Love Hush Puppies.  They are comfortable and I can get a heel low enough for me to be comfortable</review_text>
The slippers are what I expected. With only a month, I can only say they do the job</review_text>
Great overall shirt.  Good quality, wears well.  Wear it proudly</review_text>
This sweater fits perfect - exactly what I was looking for and I coudn't go wrong with this fabulous price.  My husband liked it as well</review_text>
I bought this bag as a gift for a lawyer friend. She loves it, and has told everyone about it. The color allows her to express her personailty while remaining professional, and the size and durability of the bag allow her to eliminate a separate purse, lunchbag, and carryall</review_text>
Comfy, tough, lightweight, wrinkly (like me). Surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is. Good stitching. Velcro® back pockets will save your wallet! Doesn't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear-freak cargo pockets. Not for the tidy country-club set who need creases on everything, but just perfect for active soccer Dads or when the family hound insists on playing Fetch with muddy logs and the like</review_text>
Like wearing a moccasin only with more support. More supple than most Driving Shoes, and light weight too. Soles wear very well, as do uppers. A Great looking shoe that has become my favorite knocking around shoe, yet plenty dressy for evenings eating out in Southern Cal</review_text>
So glad I didn't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them. This wallet is slimline and holds all my cards.It's been 6 months since I wrote this review, and I only become more satisfied with this wallet. All my cards are easily accessed, viewed and I know immediately if one is missing. The leather is silky soft and durable. People have been asking where I found this item. I think it's the best I've ever purchased</review_text>
We ordered this case for our son's Creative player, and it's a hit. It fits snuggly, he can access all the functions with no problems, and the loup allows him to attach it to a variety of cords and "leashes" during different activities.A great value for the money!</review_text>
I just don't know where to start.  There just doesn't seem to be a way to describe the comfort.  You will just have to try them on to believe it.  My neighbor, mother, husband and I all swear by this product.  Accept no substitutions.   Attractive...no, but the comfort will blow you away</review_text>
These are the best ever!  I bought these for my daughter and at first was nervous about ordering something like this online and because I had seen similar 'crocs' at local stores for far less.  Well, these are worth every cent!  My daughter and I went to a local store and she compared the way these felt to the local brand...no comparison!  These are the best</review_text>
I wore these shoes when I worked on my feet all day and they really helped with pain in my feet, ankles, knees and hips. I could really feel the difference from my other work shoes and the "teeth" in the shoes on the soles of my feet really felt good. Being diabetic, I am very concerned about circulation and I believe this was a good purchase. A little expensive, but well worth it in the end. I plan on buying more</review_text>
Soo comfortable and soo warm.  The only thing that sucks about them is that they aren't waterproof</review_text>
I bought these boots just in time before the crazy weather started.  Let me tell you,these boots are great!!!!!!  I read all the reviews and bought them a half size bigger and now they're a little big, regardless, I love them and another thing, they keep my feet very warm and cozy</review_text>
I read the reviews and alot of people said they run 1 to 2 sizes to big. So I always wear a eight and I ordered a 9. They were huge on me. I sold them to a friend. also the ankle part was really wide for my foot when it was in the boot. I'll stick to my Ugg's</review_text>
Please note, I did not find the need to order up many sizes.  I only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly.  Nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction, nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back.  I loves these boots and at a great price too.  Fast efficent shipping as well.  I should say that I bought a pair of White Mountain Suede Shearling boots and I was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality</review_text>
Purchased this for my girlfriend.  Told me that fits well and was very happy with this.  I am glad to get such a good price on them too</review_text>
I have tried many different sports bras and this one is truly wonderful</review_text>
and I am very pleased with them.  They are very comfortable!!  My sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy</review_text>
This is my husband's favorite shirt because it's light and comfortable. It is my favorite shirt for him because it needs no ironing and always looks crisp and neat</review_text>
These are the most comfortable briefs I have ever worn.  They are worth every penny, in my opinion.  They are designed for a man, plus they seem to not gather moisture, as some fabrics do</review_text>
I was looking for the lightest, slimmest possible wallet, and the Dopp Getaway is just about perfect.  For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying "Dopp" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.Overall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet.</review_text>
It will definitely get her attention in the best possible way</review_text>
This is my first Charles by Charles David shoe.  The material is good, the size too. The only uncomfortable issue was the open toe side, but it after 3 days using them it was ok.Very nice shoe but definetly it is not a $100 dollars one, if you pay less than $50 will be fair</review_text>
My twin sister bought these for me, and initially I thought they were too tall and they would never be comfortable.Breaking them in wasn't so hard - although the little 'ball' part made the top of my foot hurt at first.But now, they feel stable, comfortable and easy to walk it. They feel perfectly balanced and I've never experiance blisters in these shoes.Two thumbs up</review_text>
I really liked my tote bag.  What I liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that I use mine to tote my books in college.  The only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping.  Let me tell you when I say the company sent the bag "stuffed" in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship.  That was foul!  Despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and I guess I shouldnt complain as much</review_text>
For the price, these bags cannot be beat!  There aren't terribly large, but they are just the right size to fit the goodies that I purchased for my girls.  I am having them personalized and they will be ready to give</review_text>
I am happy with this bag (I got the pink and white one). It is a lovely color, nice size, durable and good price. It comes with an outside pocket and I received it quickly. My only complaint is that almost $7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $3.99, otherwise I highly recommend this bag.</review_text>
I wasn't expecting much based on the price, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order. The tote is a nice size, made of relatively heavy fabric and seems to be well-sewn. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. This was a great buy</review_text>
I have wide feet and getting comfortable shoes expecially dress shoes has been a problem for me.  Once again LifeStride does know the meaning of wide shoe sizes.  It fits me very well, looks great, and is comfortable.  The color, Wild Rice is a medium dark tan and is as shown. I do recommend the shoe, and of course it is available in other widths-so it is not just for wide feet</review_text>
Look what I found?  Where?  Under  there!  Under wear? ... Right there! It says, "Be the first person to write a review"  for Jockey Boxer Briefs.  Hmmmm...  no wonder no one has  reviewed these  yet -- who writes a review for men's underwear?Ok, fine, I'll do it.  I love these, my preferred brand and style. Your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item.I only buy these in black as I am a firm believer that underwear (men's especially) should not be white -- as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it's time to change them  -- it's better to be left  wondering  what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background!These hold up well for the price.  Nothing lasts forever. The elastic band is usually the first to go (after many repeated washings) before the material gives out.  i.e. they will fall off before they rot off.Finally, so I can feel like I have done a complete job in reviewing these, I had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test - the Weggie test - and these shorts handled it well...  extreme pain was reached well before the structure and/or material of the boxer short failed.  I give these a "ten tippy toes" rating for how well they performed in the test.</review_text>
This is one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The high top really supports your ankle and the shoe itself is form fitting and not one of those big bulkly tennis shoes.  It's light weight and flexilble, but still supportive. Well worth $30.</review_text>
I love these shoes and they are so cute and comfortable.  The heel is not so tall that you feel like you can't walk.  Customer service and shipping was excellent.  Best price I could find.  Don't hesitate on this purchase.  You'll love them</review_text>
Protects the Vision M without restricting it's use or synch connection. Flip screen provides extra protection but doesn't always stay in place. Shipping took a little longer than expected (more than a week) but was reasonable</review_text>
After having purchased the DLO sports case for my Creative Zen Vision M, I read horror story after horror story about the case being too tight, scratching the unit, and even leaving a sticky residue on your valuable player. I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so.The case is snug enough so your Zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this.The film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end. Fortunately, these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it. And all of this for under $10??? A great deal on an excellent product. Highly recommended</review_text>
Not very pretty but the comfort makes up for that.  I am on my feet all day and used to wear reeboks, nike etc, I decided to try the Crocs and have not gone back !!! Its like walking with slippers on. I have been wearing them for about 7 months or so and just recently tried my tennis shoes again and barely made it through the day. By that night my feet and back were hurting so bad I didnt want to do much but sit down. Right then and there I made up my mind to never go back to tennis shoes again !!!  I do wish they were a little cheaper so I could add all the colors to my wardrobe. Buy them you wont be sorry !! Stay away from the look a likes they are nothing like the original crocs in comfort !</review_text>
I wouldn't say they're my favorite pair, but I definitely like them.  Soft, Comfortable, Sexy</review_text>
These are great goggles they are as good as sweeds but don't leave marks.  they stick to your head the same way.  I have used mine in several Triathlons and they are so easy to use and adjust if needed.</review_text>
I really liked the Black Tuxedo Outfit, my son wore it in a pageant and won, so I am very very happy about that. The tuxedo fit nicely and looked very nice on him</review_text>
I purchased this tuxedo outfit w/vest for my son who was in his aunt's wedding.  He was 18mos. at the time.  It looked wonderful on him and fit nicely.  The pants were a little long but other than that it fit very nicely on him.  The tuxedo was true to size of my child.  Fast shipping from retailer as well.  I was very impressed overall</review_text>
This backpack is sturdy, good looking, very functional and at at least a third of the price of other similar backpacks I looked at, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase</review_text>
If your girlfriend is a fan of hello kitty then you can't go wrong with the cami/panty combo. Its cute but sexy. Very nice</review_text>
I made a bone head move and just bought one. It cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt. These people have areally good t-shirts. Not thin, and they are stiched well</review_text>
This is the the most comfortable and motion limiting sports bra ever.  I highly recommend it</review_text>
I just purchased Fleece Hoodies and pants by Andrew Christian, the material is wonderful.  The hoody feels luxuriously soft on my skin.  I would recommend them highly.The pansts are low-rise, since I am older, I am still getting used to that, but they too feel really good on.</review_text>
More than pleased...excited.  The price was better than local stores; should have purchased several pairs.  Easy on the feet, wear well, and on and off at the airport</review_text>
My son likes these to sleep and wear under pants in winter.  They are perfect, washing easily, and retaining their size and color</review_text>
These Wellies (rubber boots) are a show-stopper! I get lots of comments on how smashing they look - and they are very functional - I wear them in the garden, on the beach (can walk into pretty high water without getting wet) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking.Very happy with them and the price was right too</review_text>
These socks are a bit on the thin side, but they withstand a lot of wear</review_text>
Girlfriend loves these gloves, they were thicker than her original fingerless globes, however she complained about the thumbs.  She wish they had a better way to hold them on the thumb, and when not in use to restrain it back</review_text>
Got this for my dad - before his truck was a slew of mail and papers - worked out well</review_text>
I purchased the white entrance wedge sandal by Steve Madden from Amaon.com and I LOVE THEM! They are so Cute and they go with everything! Perfect fun shoe for the beach, or for a night out! People compliment me when I wear them and you will not be dissapointed! They are so comfortable and did I say that I love them! :</review_text>
This is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when I want something dressy.   It is a very pretty little bag.</review_text>
This fanny pack is superb.  The design is very roomy: a very large main compartment fully lined and zippered, and two convenient smaller zippered compartments in the outside front of bag.  Also fairly large zippered area within the main compartment, and another on the back of the fanny pack leather area near your body.  As yet I haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All zippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone. Similar fanny packs in leather stores in my town cost over $70 without all the features of this one.   It arrived soon after I ordered it. I recommend it highly.  You won't be disappointed.</review_text>
These shoes are the best!I like the removable wheel! You could heel to schooland when you got there you could take your wheels out so nobody will know that you have them on! You will be heeling across the  floor in no time if you keep practicing on them! It took me a while to get the hang of these shoes! You should be absolutely satisfied when you try out these shoes! They are the only shoes with removable wheels in the heels!</review_text>
This is the best brand of slippers I have ever owned! I have a cute pink pair that I slip into the minute I get home. They have lasted for several years now, and they are still in good shape.These slippers are so comfortable, and they stay on my feet without any effort. They are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm, and my feet never sweat in them, even without socks!This style runs large, and I wear a 1/2 size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers. After wearing them the first week, I noticed they got a little roomier, but they still stay on just fine.They are my only pair of house shoes at the moment. I just ordered a new pair in a different style (in pink, of course), and I have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me. Try Dearfoams and your feet will thank you</review_text>
Quality product, exactly what I wanted, but it runs large. I wear a half size, bought the size larger & now think I'll buy the smaller size</review_text>
Very warm and comfortable for the price.  For any price, really.  Nice, looks good, feels comfy, keeps warm and cuts wind without reducing hearing in the least</review_text>
Good bag, I thought it was a little bigger, but it worked out great</review_text>
I purchased these for my Mother as a Christmas present.  They are so soft to the touch and I was able to get them in a 7.5 wide which is unusual.  The color is nice too</review_text>
Esta tienda es muy rapida en contestar y enviar el producto adquirido.Es toy muy contento con el producto que adquiri por que es exactamente lo que deseaba.</review_text>
Very comfortable and feel. No one makes it like Under Armour</review_text>
Brand New, tags and everything !!!  Arrived within a week, no glitches. Just like ordering new from catalog. Will search and order again for merchandise all at fairer price or even 50 cut of new brand name items that either are not in stock in your size, or can't be found in store or are marked up 20% 0r more!LUUVV ITT!!!!!!!BONNI</review_text>
This item was shipped quickly and on time.  It stands out, not the same-old, same-old zip-up hoodie.  Would recommend this seller and item-(to any yankee fan).  Thanks for reading.  =</review_text>
I got 3 sets of these boxers not knowing much about the quality, fitting, material, etc... All I have to say is these are well worth for the price</review_text>
This swim jock is a great all around jock.  Very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps.  Mine has taken a beating, and has not fallen apart like other jocks I own.  The swim style is cut very low in front, with a fairly small pouch.  Not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts, it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play.  The low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans, not to mention the barely there skimpy factor.  Heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans.....looks and feels hot!  If you're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear, this jock is a great buy for the price.</review_text>
i made a poopie in my pantys so you are mean i love camo hats i'm 5 and i live in new york city in a apratmant that is fancy so you are stupiodo haeds.ps im in the army</review_text>
The fatigues were just what my son wanted.  The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order.  I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom.  But my son didn't want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg.  Other than that it was an excellent product</review_text>
This top runs small, so order next size up.  Vibrant colors, nice fabric, comfy, attractive fit.</review_text>
The product arrives just as shown. Sturdy, attractive leather. Just the right size for small items. This is an A++ product</review_text>
Good quality, well built vest of full bodied fleece.  Vest is slightly fitted at the waist for a feminine look and the arm holes are neatly close fitting to keep the warmth in.  Sizes run alittle large.  I love my extra small vest and my daughter loves her small vest</review_text>
I bought this because I needed something to run in as well as use as an "all around light weight jacket"  This does the trick, very light, great in the rain. I am very pleased with the product and the customer service was top notch</review_text>
I bought these boots when they were on sale. Definitely worths the money! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in, and they are really comfortable. Whoever saw my boots loved them</review_text>
I love these shoes, they are so comfortable and give great support. These are my second pair. The merchant got them to me really fast and I appreciate that. Though when I ordered I thought the amazon site specified free shipping so I was surprised at that</review_text>
I have been a fan of ASICS shoes for many years my feet tend to overpronate, which puts a terrible strain on my knees and arches. Asics duomax technology allows me to run comfortably which I love to do but stopped for many years due to the strain on my joints,until I found these shoes. I absolutely love these shoes they have helped me regain the confidence and comfort to enjoy running again. This is the only type of shoe I will ever buy and has been the only one I have bought  for 7 years now ! I highly recommend this shoe! Especially if your feet tend to overpronate</review_text>
My baby loves his new kicks!! They came quick and would recomend them to anyone</review_text>
My husband is a big man and very rough on belts.  Most belts last him a few weeks.  This one has lasted him 3+ years.  The only reason I'm buying him a new one is because he's lost so much weight.  There's still 'lots of miles' left in the belt I'm replacing.  Definitely got our money's worth out of it</review_text>
Shirt looks good, its a tighter fit not lose. Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles</review_text>
The boots arrived packaged in their original packaging and individually wrapped inside.  These boots will never disappoint...they are fun, warm, comfy and stylish!  Dont forget to spray with silicon before taking them out</review_text>
I bought these just a couple of months ago but i've already put them to the test. I went hiking to a waterfall in Mexico, I ended up covered in mud, my new shoes included. I was worried they would be spoiled (it really was a lot of mud). Then I just washed them with running water and all the dirt was gone. Besides being really comfortable, it's great to know that you can use them in all types of terrain and they will do the job.</review_text>
I love this purse! I just wish I could get it in the emerald color, too. I have the magenta.</review_text>
Finally!  I've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years. These enhancers are well-shaped and incredibly comfortable.  When ordering, go ahead and get the B/C size.  Even if you are an A or low-B. These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.</review_text>
For me, they are very difficult to put on.  I have to use a long shoe horn. They aren't tight, in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm. They look great if you like the UGG look.  I'm hoping when they loosen up, they will be easier to put on.  The top scrunches down when I put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on. It could be me though!Otherwise, I love everything else about them.Van C</review_text>
This was a very nice item.  I bought it for my mom for christmas.  She loved it.  It was shipped very fast and I was informed very well on shipment information.  This shoe was a great deal.  Usually they are pretty expensive but they had a great deal.  Thanks!</review_text>
Very comfortable, but the straps keep coming loose.</review_text>
My daughter simply loves this item. Very handy, compact, and versatile. A great wonderful gift for anyone's daughter.</review_text>
These are perfect for low-rise pants. The cut will likely be flattering for any guy. The front pouch design allows for maximum comfort and moveability, and I find the fit in the back to be basically great. An essential for those whose jeans hang low</review_text>
The skin fits well & the belt clip works well. It seems a bit bulkier than my friend's Zen skin & belt clip...but she paid about $10 more than I did! I would definitely recommend this product. I have yet to use the armband so I can't review that right now.My only issue is the screen protector fits into the window of the skin, not Zen screen. So the screen protector is smaller than the Zen screen. The window of the skin covers a couple millimeters of the top of the screen, but that part only tells the time anyway</review_text>
Excellent product. Item arrived fast and exactly as described. Works like a charm. Haven't yet had TSA open the lock, but it does the job</review_text>
Once my best friend described my bra size as "beige."  Meaning that when you shop in the "full figure" section of a department store, you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny's closet. Most of the bras are beige, with some black or white ones, and all are gigantic and ugly.If this sounds familiar to you, then this is the bra for you.  It looks pretty, comes in a variety of colors, and I at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences.  The cups do the supporting, so the bra doesn't need to have those super-wide, heavily padded straps.  And it gives a good silhouette under clothes, but will also look nice by itself</review_text>
What can I say, these are pretty and practical. I know my boyfriend is going to be impressed, after the shock wears off. I like these panties, I like the lacy look, so divine, and I like the way they ride pretty low. And they don't show through your clothes. Like my dear gal pal Ophella, I can imagine a naughty situation or two where I could have a little illicit and harmless fun. Yikes! What am I saying</review_text>
Who hasn't wanted a pair of these since they were a little girl? So glamorous, girly, and sexy. I was surprised how comfortable they are on the foot. They really do feel like slippers, just with the heel as a bonus. I normally wear a 6W or a 6 ½, so these are a little snug, but not too bad. So glad I bought them- two pairs red & black. Pink will be next..</review_text>
My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour</review_text>
Not all bras are created equal.  But what makes it so special?  As a fuller figured female, let me explain the merits:1)Support - it does a great job. This bra does not sag over the course of the day.  Your figure looks just as great in the evening as when you put the bra on in the morning.2)Coverage - this gives the modest more coverage so people don't see what you don't want them to see.  For starters, the fabric is thicker than any bra that I have ever owned.  And no, this is  not a padded bra, the material is just thicker.  Since the material is thicker, it means that it is truly opaque.  Not even with the thinnest and whitest t-shirt will you be embarassed.3)Comfort - this bra is quite comfortable, especially considering that it is an underwire.  I have not experienced the sensation of  underwire digging in nor the straps gouging my shoulders.  But on occassion I do feel some pressure from one of the straps (hence the 4 star rating).Now there are a few things that may give you pause.1)Price - this bra averages $60-65 in department stores, not a cheap undergarment.2)Size - this bra is larger compared to other bras of the same size.  What I mean is that the bra has a defined shape... it does not lie flat as the cups are molded.  And there is more fabric that connects the cups together.  A good descriptive word is "substantial", but don't think bulky.  This bra does disappear under t-shirts giving you a beautiful form rather than a body marked by undergarment lines.This is an undergarment that I intend to buy again... and again... and again</review_text>
Excellent quality for the price I paid.  Very happy with purchase. Arrived in a timely manner</review_text>
My husband really likes the Intimo Men's Classic Silk Pants.  They are very comfortable, and the color is really nice.  He wears them almost every day!The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length</review_text>
This is a great and comfortable bra, and it works for me. It's a MINIMIZER, and is great for larger sizes. I exercise a lot and it provides great support, even good enough for running on the treadmill. I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years. I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more, and it is half of what I paid in the mall. Now it is all I wear for everyday :)</review_text>
I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.I like this bra because it fits me so well, but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton, so it dries fast!  It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra, because sports bras suck.  If I could, I would people the lingerie world with these bras. The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related:  Don't wear it with a sheer shirt!  I wish there were another version, "Opaque Tapestry," maybe.  Then I'd never buy any other bra</review_text>
I give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle I ordered , I like it. Delivery is fast. I will order something else</review_text>
I  just love the color and the way it looked on me . IT  is a very very pretty jacket</review_text>
...these are comfortable. You can actually forget you're wearing them. And if you are like me and worn just about every thong there is, that is huge. I was thinking I should just stop wearing thongs at all until I found these. I've washed my pair a couple times in the regular cycle and dried them, and it still is holding up well. I'm back on Amazon.com to buy more. Go for it girls, you won't regret it! Sexy and comfy. Could you ask for more...I now own three pairs</review_text>
After having plastic tags crack and break off my suitcase, a leather bag tag is what i needed.  They stay on the suitcase and don't break</review_text>
These shoes not only look great but feel wonderful. They are so light weight and comfortable. Great product at a great price</review_text>
This company gave me very good service. They called me personally a couple of times to make sure they had everything correct. I was a bit diappointed that in the bigger sizes the selection of color isn't large but that is okay. They were out of Granny Apple and so we had to get Red</review_text>
Very comfortable.  Better quality than most.  Good rubber sole and lotsa fur inside.  Sizing appears to right on for me.  I take an 11 shoe and the 11 fits just right.  The laces actually do tighten them up and pull the back up so my heels don't pop out as normally happens with a new shoe.  I doubt they will last very long outside, but who wears slippers to the store??  Highly recommended!</review_text>
Good construction and material for the price.  Size seems a bit different in L vs. R unless I am more asymmetrical now than I noticed before?  Nice sheepskin material.  I am hoping this lasts longer than the previous moc I purchased by Acorn</review_text>
Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either.I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals.</review_text>
This product is what I expected when I buy a Carhartt product.It's a quality item and worth the money I spent</review_text>
Turf Gear is initally marketed for use with football players, well I think the year Bill Clinton became President was the last time I donned shoulder pads, but it didn't stop me from being active later in life.  With Long Sleeve Turf Gear shirts from Under Armour, I was hoping that the product would live up to the description.  A long sleeve shirt that is skin tight, yet allows your skin to breath?  Material that wicks sweat away from the skin?  Sounded almost too good to be true, but I took a chance anyways.So far I've used mine both hiking and cycling, with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more.  Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on, it stretches and breathes amazingly well.  I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.  I must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling, these shirts are amazingly durable!  I feel the price is definitely worth it, excuse me while I go order more</review_text>
I love this bag! I purchased the pink/chocolate color and I get alot of compliments on how cute it is. I am in my early 20's and I have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what I need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time, is very stylish. I really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms, but they are very expensive. This is lightweight, made of cotton, so very easy to clean. I chose standard shipping and it came so quickly. I am very satisfied with my purchase</review_text>
I'm very pleased with the comfort and design and appearant durability. I just wish it would get colder and stay cold long enough in Arizona to wear them more often:</review_text>
It's just what I wanted. I pulled out the removable sections because I prefer a slimmer feel.</review_text>
These sweaters are a fantastic value for $18.  Quality is excellent, though the colored trim may not appeal to all tastes.  Note that the fabric is somewhat thicker than most merino wool sweaters and the sizing on this model is a little snugger than the other Raffi merino sweaters</review_text>
I was pleased with all purchase.  I did not feel that I was given enough consideration on shipping costs as a very old and loyal customer.  In addition for reasons that are not clear to me, I continue to get duplicate orders, or the order is sent to an old address.  The return process in this circumstance is cumbersome and communicating with you and receiving a cogent response is quite difficul</review_text>
The Disney cars shoes were awesome for my grandson.  He loved the racing lights and the wheels on the sides.  They are somewhat tight because of the elestic on the insides, but they were a big hit for him.</review_text>
Having looked extensively for a casual parka that works well with jeans I finally found this one. I ordered on-line, and then received a phone call from the company supplying this product through Amazon, verifying that the size I ordered was correct.  The person I spoke with was very friendly and helpful.  She helped me decide that I needed a larger size and I'm very glad because when the parka arrived it was the perfect size.  I love all the pockets.  It has just enough lining to be warm yet comfortable.  And best of all it looks great with jeans and other casual clothing. The outer shell is also very soft.</review_text>
I have purchased several shoes from Nine West and for the price these are very comfortable boots and of good quality. I would highly recommend them because they are the kind of boot you can wear all day long. The calf of the boot is very generous and the heel height is exquisive for walking in fashion.</review_text>
not as pretty as I hoped on my feet but an overall great shoe and fit. DO not regret the purchas</review_text>
I'm a size 0-2, I ordered a size small, if I ordered another pair I would probably get a medium, due to dryer shrinkage. They fit in every way, but they are so revealing I'm barely comfortable going outside.</review_text>
I bought these shoes for my husband. I ordered them on a Monday and they were at my house by Wednesday! I have owned a pair of "real" Birks before and these look identical to them. My husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones</review_text>
I ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well.  I've been wearing Birks and various varieties of them for years.  I'm always very satisfied with the fit, delivery time, and the customer service that i receive from Midwest Sports. I wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow, but as soon the walkways and streets are clear, I'm back in them with thicker socks of course.They can be a little stiff at times, but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing, you will love them like no other</review_text>
Well, since I will be using this soon, I believe it will be just perfect. Holds all the necessary items safely, so will let you know when I return from my trip</review_text>
Material was not overly thick and designs were great! Look good on my daughter</review_text>
At first I thought i wouldn't like this bra because it has to be pulled over you head to put it on. However, this is the most comfortable bra I bought, and I bought a lot of different kinds. This is perfect for engorgement and just plain daily comfort</review_text>
I'll start with my stats: I'm a size 8, 5'2", and I carry my weight in my rear and thighs (all extra 20 pounds of it). This skirt is lovely, it hides what should never be seen (refer to the 20 pounds above...) and helps create a slimming line. I've worn it with silk blouses, stockings, and high heels and I've worn it with slouchy sweaters, tights, and chunky mary janes -- it works perfectly with both</review_text>
I got these socks as a gift at my baby shower.  I've looked everywhere trying to find them so I could buy more.  These socks stay on my little boy's feet and are made very well</review_text>
My son really liked this, although I recommend that you check sizes exactly as I thought that a size L Big kids would be big but it is just the right size for an 11 or 12 year old</review_text>
I love my Clarks and I can get such good prices through Amazon.  I havebought two pairs of Clarks with Amazon and I plan on buying more inthe future.  Bett</review_text>
The product was as advertised and delivered on time</review_text>
These are great shoes! The shoes are a medium-to-baby pink and they're very "high style". The shoes run true to size.  The shoes are surprisingly comfortable and I got lots of raves when I wore them to a recent wedding.  They're great shoes at a good price</review_text>
I ordered these shoes for my wedding, so you can imagine my nervousness.  I received them within a week and fell in love!  I've shown them to my bridal party and my mother and have received nothing but raves!  Even at the shoe repair where I had no-skids put on them and the dress shop where I had a fitting no one could take their eyes off my shoes!Order a 1/2 size smaller</review_text>
The shoes are comfortable. Easy to wear and feel great with or without socks!</review_text>
This is the best of the small front pocket wallets available.  Other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that don't work well.  This is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet, only reduced to 4x3 inches.  Holds three cards, bills, and ID as well as having a little room under the ID card for business cards.  Great buy</review_text>
These are so pleasing on the eye. What can I say besides the fact that these jeans fit great, look great, and attract alot of attention. Buy them!!</review_text>
There so warm and cozy for those long winter nights and they're good for mountian hikers. The keep your feet warm and dry</review_text>
I love this Guess oval tag necklace.  It is just like the Tiffany's oval tag necklace, and it has an adorable little rhinestone dangle.  The best part is the price.  I only had to spend $18.00 for it, and there is also a matching bracelet for only $15.00!  I would recommend this to anyone of any age</review_text>
My husband thought this was a great shirt as an avid golfer.</review_text>
The whole Rubber wristband thing has gotten out of hand.  do your part to put it to rest by buying regular wristbands.  When it was all for charities before-thats okay.  but it is ridiculous now.  heres the rules:-Livestrong= okay because that was the original-Everything else= NO.-People who wear like 5 of them= Probably the main reason why you'd starting wearing the regular ones.Plus they're way better and not some cheap piece of rubber that cost .2 cents to make.anyways...END THE FAD!!!</review_text>
I love these shoes. I bought 3 colors and they are great! They are very stylish AND comfortable and that is hard to find in a dress shoe</review_text>
I got so many compliments on these shoes the first time I wore them to work. They are very pretty and preppy looking. I wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater. The green is very bright, so they don't match everything, but it's a standout accessory. Wore them without socks and had no blisters</review_text>
Sharp set of shoes.  Comfortable, too, and they fit well.But I believe they were shipped on Cinderella's Coach - while the mice were still mice.  It took FOREVER to arrive, so be warned</review_text>
Very nice sandal, lookes great with a dress or jeans. Low enough to wear for hours at a time, but high enough heel to make it look chic</review_text>
I liked the shoes, they look nice, my only concern when I first received them was the quality of the cover leather, at the begining it looked like plastic. But otherwise they fit perfectly</review_text>
My husband refused to wear slippers and it was driving me nuts that he walked barefoot all the time, he said he could never find slippers that were comfortable enough.  Since the Red Sox are his favorite team and the reviews were so good on these particular Reebok slippers I thought it was win-win all around so I bought them as part of his Valentine's gifts.  Needless to say, they were a big hit, he LOVES them!  They are comfortable, modern looking and the Red Soz logo made his day.  I would buy these for any sports lover with their favorite team logo on them</review_text>
I bought these for my husband, and he loves them.  The material is soft and comfortable, and they keep his feet warm.  They are also easier to slip on and off than his previous pair of slippers.  He wears 11 1/2 wide, so I got him the XL pair, and they fit him well</review_text>
quick shipping and a great product, I am looking forward to using it VERY soon</review_text>
The shoes are not exactly what I wanted bacause I was trying to get the same shoe that I had purchased some years ago. Times change and so does style. I searched everywhere and these were the closest to what I wanted. The Keds shoes from Amazon which I ordered and received on time might I add, were more like what we used to call Bo Bos and the rhyme used to go like this..... "Bo Bos they make your feet feel fine, Bo Bos they cost a dollar 99, Bo Bos." Don't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing. I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again. Oh and one last thing, if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip, it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. They make some really cool things for kids today. Like the Keds Girls' Jazzy Sneaker. Hope it's not just because I haven't grown up yet</review_text>
It is a must have for all monty python and the holy grail fans!</review_text>
Bought this as a gift for my husband who loves the movie. He loved it from the minute he saw it. Whenever he wears it it seems that someone makes a positive comment about it.  It is amazing how many fans of the movie there are.A great gift for Holy Grail fans</review_text>
My wife used this to get a better fit into her wedding gown.  In retrospect, she wonders if it would've worked even better if she had worn a traditional strapless bra over the Shape and Size bra</review_text>
This was a great purchase, and I love keen shoes.  My only complaint is sweaty feet when it's hot, and the shoes don't dry out very quickly</review_text>
My girlfriend thinks they're sexy and they're solid underwear.  No swampiness from boxers or boxer briefs.  If you're a briefs guys (I switch around), these are the way to go</review_text>
This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips.  Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff</review_text>
This is, by far, the most comfortable pair of unders I've ever worn. Over the years, I've gone with boxers and with briefs, and in the boxers vs. briefs contest, both are losers compared to the Contour Thong. There's no elastic to chafe the legs yet there is full support. The Contour Thong has a Y thong back, and you don't need to have the body of an International Male/Undergear model to wear these. For any guy with an open mind, I recommend these -- just buy one or two pairs and give a try</review_text>
I am very happy with the swimsuit.  Delivery was as stated.  Fits wonderfully.  The only problem was once I was wearing it, a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing, but I tucked it in whenever it was noticeable.  I was very happy that the suit fit nicely because I was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping.  The size I ordered was the size I normally wear and as I said, it fit great</review_text>
great flats! Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already. The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot, but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time.</review_text>
This is absolutely one of the most comfortable heels I have in my closet.great buy good pric</review_text>
The New Balance 991 GL (and 991 and 990 before it) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use (even some cross training). I have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support, wear well and are well ventilated. The 991 GL carries on that tradition. Hopefully, the 992 will be just as good</review_text>
I am not a runner; thus, I use the shoes for typical tasks such as shopping, errands, hanging out, etc.  I have owned many shoes over the years, and these are probably 1 of the 2 most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  I am hooked on the New Balance line of running shoes.</review_text>
ProsThey don't hurt the back of your heelsComfortable like walking with socks onConsVery thin,you can see your toes thru the fabric on the top.Bottom line, they are a good buy for the price.  Very cute, stylish, and comfortable</review_text>
I bought several things from this seller and this was among my favorites. My husband loved the way I looked in it. I must admit I was not that sure I wanted to buy something like this online...mainly because I am extremely picky with the quality of the things I buy...and also because I tend to be between sizes. But I ordered size 34 and looked perfect on me. I am very pleased with this seller. The order was shipped promptly and arrived in very good condition..</review_text>
This shoe is great. It even came with an extra pair of shoe strings that had a different design. The only thing that I felt it lacked was extra comfort. I wear Skechers and have done so for years and I have had other styles that were more comfortable although this was not top comfort it was definitely wearable and did not hurt my feet.It was a great deal that I just couldn't pass up and definitely worth the price :</review_text>
The Moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be! Perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening... I am buying another pair.</review_text>
I am totally satisfied with the merchant and the product</review_text>
Everything you need that your iPod didn't come with, at one low price.  Shipped promptly</review_text>
fits great on my ipod nano. does not slip off like other silicone covers. pretty durable and great protective piece for the nano.con: do plastic cover or protection for the screen</review_text>
Oh my gosh!  I was so excited to see this item.  My 15 year old and all of his buddies are big fans of Napoleon Dynamite and this t-shirt is an exact replica of the one worn during the famous election rally dance!  I will be a hit on Valentine's Day with this gift!</review_text>
I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!</review_text>
My husband, the Star Wars fanatic, loves them!  Very comfy</review_text>
I bought a couple of these bodysuits because I thought that they were quite amusing. The quality seems ok - I have not washed them yet so I can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees.This would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - Hope this helps future buyers!!!</review_text>
Great item!  Have already used several times and is exactly as is described</review_text>
This is a really soft, and very comfortable pillow.  It is priced great, a lot cheaper than similar microbead travel pillows.  I am very satisfied</review_text>
I couldnt resist these shoes for the price...I've had good experience with Bandolino branded shoes.  I have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable.  Sure enough, this pair of boots are very comfortable too!  The color is a great burnished bronze, that is a great neutral color to wear (plus metallics are in fashion again).  The zip-up is easy, and the calf is roomy.  I'm very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars, but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes</review_text>
I ordered this boot in a size 7, Pewter.  Very cute boot and fits perfectly.  Very comfortable fit and feel.  Everyone who saw them wanted to know where I got them!  Simply darling boot</review_text>
I have really enjoyed my sunglasses.  Quick shipment and great price make this a must buy item.  Would buy from again</review_text>
These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price. And they were delivered faster than expected</review_text>
This is my 2nd set of these type of curlers.  The last ones stayed with me for three years.  They are so good, I stopped using the "big, home set" and use these type daily.   Heat up fast, great lasting curl (particularly for hard to curl fine hair), and don't even need to leave them in that long.Would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl.   Recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl</review_text>
I bought this pump in Bonsai color. The pump was true to size. They are more cute than in the phot</review_text>
This was my first time using Amazon and it was great. I have bought other things over the net but by far this was the most seamless. Lets do it again next time.Lawhote</review_text>
I purchased these boots hoping they would fit and not hurt my feet.  I have arthritis in one foot and can hardly wear shoes because of the pain.These boots fit very well, look great, and I can wear them longer than any shoe I have had in the past year!!  I love them</review_text>
I love these shoes! They are so comfy and look good. The price is a bit steep, I think, but considering I could wear them practically every day and not get tired of them, I guess they are worth it. Definitely considering purchasing another pair in brown!</review_text>
I ordered 3 products from Dance Now...None of them fit being at least one size too small. When I contacted Dance now regarding this issue they told me that these shoes are sized for Women. Men need 2 sizes larger in their street shoe size. I found no reference to that detail on the Amazon website. Dance Now representative told me it is referenced on their own website. But Amazon does not make that fact known.So now I have 2 orders I have to pay shipping to Dance Now as well as their exhchange cost. I am a bit unhappy over this</review_text>
These were nice, lightweight budget jazz shoes; however, they do NOT fit the same as street shoes, despite what the description says. My daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes, and I ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth. WRONG! I have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5.5. BEWARE</review_text>
I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them. They're well made and super comfortable. He liked them so much he bought another pair in a different color. Highly recommended</review_text>
I bought these for my son, and he says they are really comfortable; he wears them when he plays basketball--lots of support and no blisters.  I'll most likely buy another pair for him..</review_text>
I love this bra!  It is very comfortable and like the other reviewer said, adds a whole cup size!  Cheaper than Victoria's Secret and well made</review_text>
BEWARE:  This bra WILL increase the appearance of your breasts a full cup size or more!  The only draw back to acquiring this bra is slyly wearing it without family and co-workers knowing something's up.This bra is made from good materials.  The cups are thick and smooth and the straps are study and comfortable. The liquid is ample but not noisy or lumpy.  The cup fabric is itchy at first, but a handwash in woolite will fix that.The only problem I have, is that this bra doesn't push the breasts up to the cup!  I prefer low-cut blouses and would feel more confident in a "push-up" design.Otherwise, it's a truly effective bra to give you non-surgical results</review_text>
these shoes are so cute and sexy! High heels makes a girl look so much longer and leaner!Beware though, if you've never bought naughtys i would go to a store and try them on first b4 buying online. I wear 8's in EVERYTHING but these, i wear 7.5. LOVE THEM!</review_text>
These socks are absolutely the best. I take pilates classes and if it is hot your feet can slip off the mat. (Not good in the middle of a side plank!)Anyway these socks keep your feet planted and dry. One note; make sure not to order them big, the idea is that they should be snug</review_text>
I wrote a rave review of these the day I got them.  They were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug.  However, the next time I wore them for a longer session, they got stretched out. My toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way.I put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance, they were very uncomfortable.Oh well.  The "concept" is great, but they don't really work unless you're doing very little movement.  I wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job</review_text>
I brought a pair of the Beach/Garden Clogs from Cozee World,  the order was shipped quickly,  and when I realized the size was wrong,  they even allowe dme to exchange them for the correct size.  It was Overall good service.  thanks</review_text>
I received these today in the mail and am pleased with the way these feel on my feet,they are so comfortable and so easy to slide on</review_text>
we needed a ruch delivery for our vacation of some quality water shoes with a decent price, we were treated superbly. our order took less than 3 full days to arrive. we will use amazon again to fine deals and service like this</review_text>
Great product with speedy delivery. The shoes arrived before I expected and were exactly what I wanted. Thank you!</review_text>
I just recieved my shoes today and can't believe that these shoes fit perfectly. The wide size 8.5 is just what I needed. I am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as I would often have with other shoes. I love the value as I purchased these for only $19.79.</review_text>
The shoes are comfy and of great quality. I wasn't sure if I liked the buckle, but decided to risk it b/c of the great price. The buckle is a nice accent and overall I'm am very happy with the shoes.</review_text>
the shoes were in great shape, the shipping speed was fast, really satisfie</review_text>
I love this umbrella. It's just the right size and works perfectly. It's so pretty that I don't want to get it wet!!</review_text>
These were ordered for my son for regular sledding and tubing activities. He thinks they are warm and comfortable - not stiff like similar snow pants from other manufacturers.  They are a great value</review_text>
I love these underwear. I have not bought them from amazon yet, but I plan to. I will wear them until Jockey stops making them. I have worn these for the past 3 years, or so, and they are so soft and comfortable. Highly recommended</review_text>
Good quality product at very reasonable price. Postage was quick even though I'm in the UK. All round good service</review_text>
It's nice and has yet to fall apart in 10 belly dancing classes.  The only thing is that every other triangle does not have coins, so you are only getting half as many coins as pictured.  However, for the price I would rather that than have it full of coins and falling apart.</review_text>
Now this Military Style Combat Boot is one of a kind! It takes a while to break it in but after, you will enjoy it! It looks so cool just looking at it, never mind wearing it! its leather is tops! And it WILL last a life time! Not water proof, but great for jungle trekking! Shines easy</review_text>
I bought this for my wife as a "throw in" with more expensive items because it was so cheap.I actualy forgot I even ordered it until it came in. I was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me. Unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture. She is a size small and it fit perfect. This not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me. The only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up</review_text>
This is an amazing product. I bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature. believe me, there is no comparison. not only is the Halo product made better, and is more durable and holds the baby better, but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too. I trust this company because the product is recommended by the SIDS society. I don't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle, because he is so secure in it.</review_text>
These shoes are great!  My daughter tried to talk me into giving them to her.  Quick Delivery.  Good Quality</review_text>
Great delivery & of a quality product and the speedy service is one reason i still use amazon today is b/c of sellers and products like this 2 thumbs up !</review_text>
Just got them in the mail today. As other kenneth cole reaction shoes, it runs one size larger. I'm usually a 12 but I ordered an 11 and they fit just right. These boots look great with jeans. The color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph.</review_text>
I had the opportunity of wearing these for my husband before I left for the west coast and my annual visit with my friends and our second annual lingerie party. My hubby couldn't believe I'd wear something like this, but boy oh boy, he didn't object. He couldn't take his eyes off my, well you can just imagine what it was he couldn't take his eyes off of</review_text>
I purchased one of these cases for my sister-in-law, and she liked it so much, that I bought one for me too.  I really like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a great carrying case for their DS Lite.The vendor that shipped both of the cases did a great job of a quick shipment of a case that met all expectations.  I would purchase from them again without hesitation</review_text>
This bag is perfect as a commuter bag on my bike.  The cell phone pocket is very accessible and the bag is large enough to hold a change of clothes, but not so large everything gets lost inside</review_text>
these are so great, and keep my baby's feet warm.  She even slept with them on with no problem.  She's been a master at getting her socks off up until now.  They also protect her feet as she is starting to stand and was breaking toenails.  She's chewing on the toes but I haven't seen any scuff marks yet, so they are holding up very well</review_text>
robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use. they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off! we've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off, but not these. its worth it to spend the extra $$ on these shoes. and they're so well made they'll last for baby #2</review_text>
I love the look. Even my friends complement it. And the wedges are so LIGHT! But you got to stick to your size. I couldn't find size 8.5 so I bought size 9 instead which was a big mistake.</review_text>
Swimsuit very cute - size as stated (16 = 20/22)  Bra did not have enough support for me so I wear a matching sports bra with it and it works very well.  I love it</review_text>
i love these shoes, they are totally cute. the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper. they aren't as soft as i thought they would be, but i great buy none the less.</review_text>
I just love different and odd things. I love to give people gifts that no one else have.Thanks</review_text>
I GOT THESE CAUSE I AM PREGNANT AND TRYING TO FIND CLOTHS THAT FIT IS KINDA HARD BUT WITH THESE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS ADJUSTABLE SNAPS FOR THE WAST</review_text>
This item was durable, warm, the right size as advertised and the right price.</review_text>
I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security</review_text>
Pros:Ultra Fast delivery w/package tracking. Item was shipped within a few hours of order. Suit is in great condition and I like the color.Cons:When they say grab bag...that means the suit may or may not look like the picture. Mine turned out to be a blue stripped jammer...which is cool with me cause I actually wanted a blue jammer. Just be prepared</review_text>
Quick service for a shoe that has been discontinued and hard to find in a size 8/black.  No complaints.. great service.  great price</review_text>
This is the only shoe I wear for High Impact Jazzercise classes four+ times per week.  I have a wide, flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly.  And with boot cut jazz pants, they look great!</review_text>
A very cool product, it got me a lot of attention on 3/22/07 at the OU student Union. At first, it was hard to work. but now, I can even spin!!!I always wear them to my mom's office</review_text>
These are hands down my favorite pair of jeans. I'm 5'5" and they are just the right length to wear with tennis shoes and midheight heels.  The stretch fabric hugs in all the right places, and the cut is slimming.</review_text>
well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. And i was not to be disappointed. They are really awesome!! They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play. I even wear them to office sometimes ;) Though after wearing them for a long stretch of time, i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star. But they are worth every single penny i spent on them.If you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too, look no furthe</review_text>
I LOVE my soft and comfortable green robe that I received last year for Mother's Day! Whenever I wear it, I want to just relax with a magazine or watch TV, and then fall asleep in it. The matching green slippers complete the feel, and I really feel pampered. I never knew I could feel SO good wearing a robe, especially since I was not really a robe wearer before receiving this wonderful plush robe! This is such an excellent product and great gift!</review_text>
I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual "crowding" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to "improve" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)I also received the shoes in less than a week and that is a miracle where I live.  Good service all around.  Hope this helps someone else.</review_text>
This is the absolute best sport bra made. I have been running 5 miles or more 5 times a week for over 20 years and once I discovered this particular model I have never switched back. The Champion also lasts wash after wash without losing it's shape. Unfortunately these great bras never seem to go on sale</review_text>
These shoes are proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy</review_text>
I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.I love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet. They're also very comfortable for a high-heeled shoe.My only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top, and there's quite a bit of toe cleavage. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter).Despite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)</review_text>
We bought this for our 13 month old for Christmas and she loves it. It is extremely soft. Her favorite part is the cell phone that rings. The compact also squeaks. I love that it is all soft so that she cannot hurt herself with it. This is a perfect gift for a 1-year-old girl</review_text>
These are very good quality slippers, comfortable & well worth the price.</review_text>
These shoes are durable, comfortable, and most importantly come in different widths.  Most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don't make anything but D width.  New Balance does.For those of you complaining about width, my guess is that if you size your feet correctly, that problem will go away.  I had always worn a 12D width, until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life I found out I need a 13B. You may think you know your feet, but you may not.As to comfort, I can't complain.  As to durability, maybe they are a little stiffer, but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others, that is well worth it in my book</review_text>
This is a fabulous find! My husband loves henley shirts...but, they have to be just the right fabric weight and sleeve length. After many failed attempts, I finally found the perfect shirt. Great look, great feel and most importantly my husband likes it too</review_text>
Nice to put on after a long day of work or after being outside shoveling the snow .Do reccomend</review_text>
Comfortable. If elastic waist degrades over time (not known yet, but has happened to other pajamas), there is no back-up draw-string. As with all flannel PJs, easily tangles with flannel sheets</review_text>
The zipper wallet is a product with a practical idea that is long overdue . It is a known fact tha all leather wallets stretch resulting in important items such as credit cards and drivers lisence, etc. slipping out, making identity  theft a serious possibilty.The zipper wallet avoids this from happening. Ironicly, this item is not available at local stores.I encourage everyone to try this product and see for yourself how useful it is in the everyday worldYours Truly ; Joe Alvare</review_text>
I bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them!  They fit great, they arrived in great condition and very quickly.  The rhinestones are really blingy in the sun!  I am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also.  Very cute for the price</review_text>
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone</review_text>
I bought these shoes for my 23 month old son. We needed something comfortable with a flexible sole, but with enough thickness in the sole to stand up outside and provide traction. They are excellent shoes and he loves them. He won't wear anything else and the shoes receive many compliments</review_text>
We just had our son in January and we couldn't resist these cute little shoes. Even though he's only 3 months old we can't wait to see our little guy in them. What a well made product!</review_text>
These shoes are stunning, original and over-the-top beautiful. I just can't understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy?? Square-toe shoes are soooo late 90-s and these shoes are anything, but "mosquito hunters". They have a perfect narrow shape, with an interesting mix of fabrics and a PERFECT toe for the current late decade of 2000. Trust me, with 117 pairs in my exploding New York closet these have ended up at the front. I'm picking up the black ones as I'm writing this. Enjoy them....I know you as well as your better half will!</review_text>
Good color visibility; nicely structured with warmth applicable to the unspeakable and inhuman frigidites of the amerikan North.The hat fits snugly and will evoke a positive commentary now and again.I have ordered Maroon but will likely add some other color choice, as the array is rather impressive. For an 100 % acrylic knit, this is not a bad hat; the only problem perhaps being that it sucks up hairs very easily, almost as if it were a hair-vacuum machine.</review_text>
They shipped these almost overnight. My daughter was a perfect little flower girl; No trips, no blisters, and they've held up great over the past 9-10 months with great durability for dance and lots of play. She was a size 10 at the time of the wedding, but the shoes were a 9? Her feet were fine. She can still squeeze into them now, and she's an 11. Very pleased. Good value. These are the exact shoes</review_text>
Now, I'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to certain things in life and one of those items just happens to be Backpacks. I spent about two months searching for a new one until I finally came across this particular model. I'll start with by saying that I love this damn thing. It has plenty of space, a whole bunch of extra cords that I suppose a hiker would use but I think just look nice, and its very durable (which is a must for me since everything I own will take a beating). I'm telling you straight from the horse's mouth, this Backpack is worth the money. Now if it only came as an 18 slot..</review_text>
It is exactly what I was looking for. I had no problems ordering or receiving it. I got to my house quickly. Nothing is wrong with it</review_text>
The PJ bottoms were soft and of good quality material. However, I ordered the extra large, and they were very small for that size.  It seemed as though the XL was more a Med/Large.  I would also think that "lounge pants" or "PJ bottoms" would be a bit bigger as you wouldn't want these types of pants too tight.  They were a gift, so I just hope they don't shrink after washing!</review_text>
These are the best windproof liner gloves out there.  I freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of Gore Windstopper and couldn't find any that said "made with Gore Windstopper" but actually it's Polarguard Windbloc.  In any case, when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing.These are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.The only "downside" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  This is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet.I wear these ice climbing, hiking, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens.These really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.  I haven't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now, a problem that plagued me for years.I can't recommend these enough.-Scott</review_text>
This is such a wonderful pair of gloves. They are light and easily portable. They can be folded and stored in one's pockets. They have features that enable use of one's index fingers and thumbs for fine operations such as turning minute knobs. The synthetic materials comprising these gloves also make them very protective against harsh weather (especially wind and rain). I am now able to run outside in icy wind despite the fact that my hands freeze more easily than anyone's elses</review_text>
These are hot, Hot, HOT!  Will be buying them in other colors.  My guy went NUTS</review_text>
The product is in good condition when it was shipped. The quality is good. Thank you.</review_text>
I bought these for my husband.  He went riding in 45ish degree weather and his hands stayed warm.  He was very happy with them and I will be buying a pair for myself !</review_text>
I purchased this robe for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift... And I wish I would have purchased one for myself as well! This robe is made of the softest, warmest materials, but is extremely light-weight, unlike most robes. "Luxurious" is the perfect adjective.</review_text>
These boots are warm and comfortable, like my sheepskin slippers.  My feet are toasty, even when it's freezing outside.  They have a thicker sole than some other styles, which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice.  I love the warm brown of the chestnut.  They look great!  At 50% off, the price was great, too</review_text>
I did order half size up because of other reviews and the length is perfect.  However, the unisex width is way too wide for me.  I have a pair of Ugg men's Ultimate and they are not as wide.Overall, I still think Uggs are a little better and more comfortable</review_text>
Most sneakers these days come in two varieties--they're huge athletic clod-hoppers for teenieboppers, or they're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies.This sneaker is the best compromise on the market today.  It's youthful without being for the young.  Light-weight, low-profile, wide enough for a thick sock, and it'll get you compliments everywhere you go.My first pair is in black, and wow, they are stylish.  Today I wore them out shopping, and my back started hurting before my feet did.  My one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed.  I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.If you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.  I'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics--I'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out, but I want these in every color</review_text>
the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got, after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80's Purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge. i was blown away</review_text>
This was just what I was looking for and couldn't find in localretail stores.  Fits perfectly in my wallet and now my creditcards don't fall on the ground in stores!  Reasonable price also.Excellent product</review_text>
I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells.  When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to).  Most of their shoes need no "break in" time.  I own these in four different colors.  My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years.  The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret.  You know, you're walking in heaven</review_text>
.....and they are very comfortable, Quality seems to be better than the last Unlisted shoe I purchased elsewhere. Haven't polished them yet so I can't say anything about that</review_text>
This merchant really delivers with this item - In the stores, this is almost twice the price.  I really wasn't expecting such quality from this item (Yes, it's Crushed Velvet, so not warm, but warm wasn't the goal). Would definitely recommend this item, and may buy another color for myself</review_text>
At first I had my heart set on a different cloak, but when it was no longer available I decided to go with this one. I am very pleased that I was not disappointed. This cloak looks and feels beautiful. It has a nice button closure at the neck, and for those that are petite it is floor length. This cloak is just what I was looking for to add a last minute touch to my Halloween costume. It is very comfortable and soft, no itchy feel here</review_text>
I bought these in black and got a ton of compliments as soon as i started wearing them... however I recommend you wear these with sheer stockings or something because they gave me a blister the size of Mt. Everest, ouch</review_text>
This item arrived on time and the quality was great. This bodysuit makes a great gift idea for "baby" - it's just how I expected it would be</review_text>
I got this shirt when it was on sale for $10 so I snatched it up quickly. I like the shirt a lot. It is very pretty on. Order the size that you normally wear. I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium. The shirt is way to big. So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt.</review_text>
This is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra!  I live in the US and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line.  It's a fabulous bra. It's very comfortable, washed up nicely and provides great support.  This is our second child and I wish I had these with the first</review_text>
This belt is seriously great.  I ordered it and it arrived 3 days later, exactly as the seller described.  I'm not sure what the previous review was all about, but my belt is great.  I love how I can use interchangeable buckles with it</review_text>
These are my single favorite pair of underwear. Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish. I'm in the military so at first I thought "thongs are not for "real men" but after wearing these I found they are, and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize. I wear these for every day activivties, sports, work, and leisure. There isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy. After wearing them for a while it's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it. If you've never owned a thong, I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the 2xist Y back thong</review_text>
I Just want to make something clear...the windbreaker is NOT Prada, the tag reads MIU MIU, a very good brand, but definetely not Prada.  I found out it looks better when it is layered with a dark jacket.  I layered it with a black Yohi Yamamoto jacket and it looked just perfect...</review_text>
Got this for my teen as an alternative to a bathrobe.  She loves it - nice & warm, pretty pink color.  They run small-she usually takes a medium -got her a large.  She could have used an XL.  Sleeves are a bit short.  She likes the look & the zip front</review_text>
These are some very nice shoes. I love the blue and black ones. These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes. They are also very comfortable. If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price, get T-Macs!!!!!!!!!!</review_text>
I have been searching for the perfect ped sock, not too thick, not so thin it slides off your heel and, most importantly, COTTON.  My search is over.  This is by far the best sock ever.  Great with sneakers AND closed in shoes.</review_text>
Yes beautiful people I too own this shoe and it is fun and sexy.  I didn't think at my age I could wear such a high wedge heel however, I was wrong and thankful to be so.  This is a fun shoe which looks great on.  I have it in the gold and I love wearing them out and about</review_text>
Great price - aprons are perfect for my mom.  She just recently suffered a stroke and I needed inexpensive aprons to easily put over her head for when she eats that look nice and does the job.  The Company sent them out right away; would order again. Just wish they had more colors and designs to choose from.  I order two packages, with 3 in each package</review_text>
I love this bra ... just the right amount of support.  Order arrived 4 days before expected ... woo hoo!!</review_text>
I like adidas brand and this is a great shirt for working out or whatever. It is comfortable and well worth it</review_text>
To echo another reviewer:I am a heavy runner with high (semi-flexible) arches and a neutral stride, running 20-35 miles per week. Even though my strides are consistent in terms of length, pronation,and heal-to-toe gait, I tend to have very heavy footfalls (being a former sprinter with muscular legs)and need a well-cushioned shoe.I am training for the Boston Marathon and have tried Asics Gel Kayanos (the shoe designed for the "clydesdale type" runner), a pair of Adidas Adistars (the newest model is a very good shoe but didn't fit my wider foot properly), and some various pairs of New Balance (least favorites of the bunch) but the Mizuno Wave 7's are by far the most natural feeling, durable, light-weight, cushioned (without being bulky) shoe I have ever owned. I have now owned two of the Wave Creation 7's and a pair of the older Wave Creation 6's and put a lot of miles on these shoes: they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there. The Gel Kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but I found that they break down far to fast for distance running (and they are slightly heavy). That and the Mizuno's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare. I am confident I could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference.I would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but I endorse it as the only shoe I will buy as long as the line continues.</review_text>
This is an excellent bra.  In addition to being sexy, it is also quite functional.  It defines one's individual breast shape well and it offers maximum support.  This particular bra comes in a pretty peach color and a beautiful black.Chantelle bras are made according to French standards.  You get a somewhat larger cup and the band size is not as long.  Still, it's an excellent bra</review_text>
For years, I wore Asics. The GT, the Cumulus, the Nimbus. But I have to say, if you're fan of any Asics shoes named after clouds, you should try the Trigon 4. Very similar, but cheaper. Also they did not joke when they called it the Ride. It has a very smooth transition and insane cushion, but a little more support than Asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight. A big thumbs (toes?) up</review_text>
I have had a pair of these for several years; they were an incredibly lucky find. They're *extremely* comfortable, better than many pairs of sneakers I've tried on. They've worn very well, and I'd say they're well made: I've only had to replace the shoelaces once. A bit of polish, some Kiwi leather cleaner and protector for water, and they're perfect. Trust me, you can walk for miles in them, and they look great, I think. A great purchase. If you're looking for a pair of dress shoes, and nervous about buying them without trying them on, well... my feet love them. Don't know how far that will carry yours, but there's my two cents. Excellent</review_text>
I was very, very pleased with the sailor outfit that included a very nicely made hat.  It fit perfectly and was ahit with Mom and Dad upon seeing him at the airport on their arrival home from being deployed for 6 months.  I found this same outfit about 25.00 more on other sites and so you can't do better on this buy</review_text>
This is a well made rugged coat. Sort of a North Face/ Mountain Hardware coat for the farm/ ranch.Not a summer coat too heavy!!! The next model needs to have pit zips!</review_text>
I have several jackets. They are well made, warm and I wouldn't wear any other. Long lasting and look good with anything</review_text>
These shoes are adorable and perfect for summer!! I love mine!!The only negative thing is that they are wide. I have normal size feet and ordered my regular shoe size. They fit length wise but are very spacey width wise</review_text>
These boxers are much nicer than the photos suggest. I was pleasantly surprised. I was trying to replace a pair I had accidentally washed in the washing machine (a no-no with this fabric). Turns out the replacements were twice the quality of what I had originally purchased. I will probably be purchasing more.Your wife will thank you for buying these. Excellent quality, and softer than satin. My only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes, because it's made without a fastener. The idea is for a sleeker feel, but it sacrifices security. Love 'em anyway</review_text>
This is really a great item, very comfortable.  I would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose.  Great for the intended purpose though</review_text>
Minimzer is correct, I bought this bra in a 38DDD and it made me look more like a D or DD. It lifted and minim1zed my breasts. My only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point. If you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you.</review_text>
These are the coolest things ever made. I have been searching for a product like this forever and I could only find what used to be called &quot;lingerie helpers&quot; from the 50's or 60's (I think) which didn't quite do the job.  No more buying those &quot;speciality&quot; bras that cost a bundle or those racerbacks that didn't quite fit right. I just put these on my favorite bra and don't even know it is there.  Now there is no excuse for me to ever see anyones bright pink bra straps peeking out from their shirts. I am just jealous that the woman who invented it is going to make millions and I am not!!!</review_text>
These are lightweight cotton thermals at a good price.  I wear a Large in most shirts and the Large size for these fits snug, especially after a wash, which is how I like it for wearing as an undershirt.  If you're buying for outerwear, you might consider going a size larger. Shipping wasn't 'Amazon Quick' but it was reasonable - about a week if I remember right</review_text>
The slippers are great; comfortable and good quality. Just like the pair I purchased in Lake George a few years ago. Buying them online was so convenient</review_text>
I absolutely love this suit, my only downfall is it runs big so order one size down</review_text>
Very comfortable and sexy. Hanky Panky is the standard in comfortable lace</review_text>
This suit is exactly what I ordered -- small enough for training/racing but not as small as a "traditional" Speedo suit</review_text>
I got it on size 32 because I usually get my pants on size 32. The bathing suit was too tight. I'll get in on size 34 next time</review_text>
I do roofing work & work outside on the hotest days. I had problems with heat rash & jock itch. My boss suggested I wear loose fitting all cotton boxers like most of the crew. I asked around & picked up some HANES all cotton boxes. WOW - what a difference -- they feel great. No binding when I work - the cotton does give a bit as you wear them. Now they are the only underwear I will wear. They do shrink a bit after washing - so do get a size up</review_text>
THIS WAS AT 1OTH BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SON.WE ARE CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS LIVING IN TEXAS, AND NO ONE HERE, AT THE TIME, HAD ANY IDEA THAT KOBE HAD EVEN CHANGED HIS NUMBER FROM 8 TO 24. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE (AND A LOT OF DRIVING AROUND) TRYING TO FIND KB'S 24.I FOUND IT ON YOUR SITE AND THE PRODUCT WAS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED, NO SURPRISES.  MY SON LOVES IT!</review_text>
A great bargain!  Saved 50% over buying separately.  Good quality.  Very satified</review_text>
These boots are a little bit on the snowboarder side of things as far as the way they look. The fit is right on and they are very warm and dry. i love them! They are very easy to just pull on and tuck your jeans into. Highly recommended</review_text>
I only use the protective case/skin, not the armband or belt clip.  I primarily wanted protection for the screen, which this provides.  The screen protector and skin fit perfectly and were easy to apply.  I can easily access all ports and manipulate all controls with them applied/installed.  I have not used the armband, but it looks pretty sturdy.  I paid $18.90 for this item including $5.95 shipping</review_text>
I bought a pair for my wife and she told me how warm her feet were while wearing them so I decided to buy a pair for myself. I wear them without socks as they are so warm and comfortable--i think wearing socks w/ these shoes would get a little too warm for my feet.</review_text>
My new Shoe Wallet is even better than I expected!  It securely fastens to my running shoe; holds my key, emergency cash, and identification; and most importantly, serves as a safe place for my iPod Sport Sensor.  Best of all, my iPod works efficiently and accurately in the Shoe Wallet without my purchasing Nike-branded shoes.I'm a very happy consumer!</review_text>
This is a fine leather bag, beautiful, comfortable!I bought on the mfr website and saved the shipping. Its a wonderful product of quality and craftsmanship!A must have</review_text>
Everyone loved me in these glasses for our "Old Fashioned Banquet"!  They completed my outfit, great price and a speedy delivery - which I really needed</review_text>
GOT THIS FOR MY WIFE, WELL REALLY FOR ME.AND BOY OH BOY DIDI ENJOY SEEING HER WALK AROUND THE HOUSE IN THIS ALL WEEKEND..THANKS AMAZON</review_text>
Very comfortable and durable.  I would wear these outside - although not for a long walk, but the sole is durable enough for walking to the mailbox or taking the dog for a brief jaunt.  I recommend these if you are looking for an inexpensive and durable slipper</review_text>
I received these slippers for Christmas in December 2005. I got the Pine green, a very nice looking slipper with lots of comfort. I am ordering another pair in Charcoal, as I want 2 pairs to have at both places I live. It's all about comfort for me when I am home, so these fit the bill. Good value as well</review_text>
THESE ARE THE SOFTEST - MOST COMFORTABLE FLIPS FLOPS I HAVE FOUND IN YEARS!   YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE EITHER</review_text>
Our son love this pair of shoes, he wears it to church or just to a party. He said that they are nice and comfy he can run with them because the have rubber soles. WE think that they are elegant as well. WE give 5 stars for them!! Very Good</review_text>
We ordered this product, and paid for expedited shipping.  8 days later, it had not arrived.  Their explanation was that it was 2 day shipping from the day of shipping, but it still took 3 days to get around to shipping.  The backpack missed the giftee, and it had to be shipped again to catch up to her</review_text>
I buy these shoes in bulk as they are so good.  I have high arches and these shoes are the only ones that have never given me any trouble.  I am now on my 3rd pair and use them for my marathon training and running</review_text>
My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.I recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!I am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.I strongly recommend this product</review_text>
I've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I've tried a LOT of different nursing bras.  I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it.  I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty "spillover" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last</review_text>
Although I prefer Jockey, these Hanes Bikini Briefs are great and I plan to order more. Great value. I also bought Fruit of the Loom but in my opinion the Hanes have a much nicer fuller cut, The Fruit of the Loom are for youngsters with tiny butts. The reason I didn't buy Jockey is they're too expensive</review_text>
Im in the military and run quite abit about 20 miles or more a week Ive had these shoes for a while now and I have to say they are the best Ive ever had as far as comfort and durabilty. My current pair is about worn out and I plan to purchase a new pair of the sam</review_text>
I purchased this bag to take on a tour of Greece and was pretty happy with it.  I loved the size, not to big and not too small, and also the flatness of it.  It was very lightweight and the compartements are easily accessible.  The only problem i had with it is that when you wear it as intended accross your body, the strap tends to rub at the neck, so  I had to keep adjusting it every five minutes.  Overall it was pretty good, though</review_text>
I have owned and worn this for several months now, and it is very durable AND warm as well! I would just be cautious about the unisex sizing, as I am a Medium sized person (10-12) and it does seem to be a little large, yet I wear it anyways.  Hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size</review_text>
Every time I wear this tie, it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were, and when cartoons were cartoons.  Also working in a place with a lot of kids, they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on.  I've had this tie for 3 years now, high quality, and does not stain really easy (at least for me, great quality).  Only downfall, a little dated with a 32 cent stamp.  Kids don't notice, and neither do most adults.  Worth picking up, great price</review_text>
These boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts. Because they are real leather, I was expecting to have to break them in before they were comfortable - but it only took a few wearings before I could wear them all day with a lot of walking and no sore feet. Didn't have any problem with them fitting my calves. I had that problem with other boots I have tried before. Even if you don't consider the great price for all leather boots, they are wonderful buy</review_text>
The boot is beautiful, but because my feet are wide they are uncomfortable to break in. The price is reasonable.  Hope to wear soon</review_text>
awesome handling while balling on this shoe. Great grip on the court and I especially like the pump on the shoe that you press to fit the shoe to how you want it on your feet</review_text>
Great fit, lightweight. These are very snug and allow for maximum mobility for quicker players who do a lot of cutting and fast movement. Support strap is not too tight which is good, and actually serves a purpose</review_text>
Let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes..........DO IT! They are not only beautiful but as high as they are, they are extremely comfortable. The detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website. My favorite shoe of the summer</review_text>
These socks are just what I was looking for, a thin cotton blend to wear running.  No bunching and they breath very well.  The price and timliness of the order was also great</review_text>
I'd been shopping for a pair of running shoes and have tried on various brands.  These shoes surpassed others in fit, support, and comfort.  I'm so glad Kayano comes in wide sizes, because it fits my feet PERFECTLY!  I highly recommend!</review_text>
Have always been pleased with this manufactures product. The company I purchased from was fair priced and very efficient</review_text>
Munsingwear is definitely the most comfortable, best fitting men's brief I have ever worn</review_text>
These were really easy for my little girl to put on herself. They were well make and very light weight. I like the ridges in the surface and hope they will help keep her feet dry and prevent the shoes from getting super stinky</review_text>
I picked this sucker up for $30 from Fred Meyer, after they made it clear that they had no other options available for charging my iPod from my computer (I was on vacation with no cord and a dead battery). I was only expecting it to last throughout the vacation, but I've been using it ever since.I keep the car charger in my car, with no extra cables to burden it, and I keep the wall charger plugged into the wall. The cable retracts easily, with a design much like that of a window blind (pull until you let go, where it locks, and then pull a bit more and let go to release).It's a small, unobtrusive, and incredibly convenient device for your iPod, and at this price, it's a steal. You'd pay two or three times this at some electronics stores for the wall charger or car charger alone, let alone one that is so solidly constructed.No question -- if you own an iPod, purchase this product. I was impressed enough to come and write this review -- perhaps you will be too</review_text>
I really like the Speedo suit.  I wear two swim suits, the Speedo and a larger "drag" suit over it.  I've done this since my days on the swim team.  The chlorine in the water tends to weaken the seams on my suit over time, causing the drag suit to self-destruct eventually.  Having the Speedo prevents any embarrassing moments.  The fit and material is good and it holds up very well - this is the first replacement I've needed in years.If you are husky, this might be a tight fit.  I wear a 42-44 pant size and this is on the snug side.</review_text>
Well constructed blazer. Great color. You can wear with jeans or shirt and tie for church.</review_text>
LOVE,LOVE,LOVE Gerber products and these are no exception. Great quality and they are so soft. The only thing is that the 0-3mths are a little small so you may want to consider starting with the 3-6</review_text>
When I saw in a magazine that Croc was making a style of their shoes that was NOT UGLY, I literally went the same day to Dillard's to get a pair for myself! They are unbelievably comfortable - it feels like you're standing on clouds!The Amazon listing doesn't show all the colors that they come in: light pink, silver, gold, celery, lavender, light blue, white, black and fuschia. All the colors are really adorable, and I had a hard time deciding!I have also had issues with sizing, just as other reviewers have had. I usually wear a 7.5 Wide in women's shoes, but when I tried on the Primas in an 8, they were ridiculously big, and when i tried them on in a 7, they were a tad too snug. I really wish they made half sizes. I ended up buying the 7, even though it was a little small, but I read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet, that works like a charm: throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat, then pull them out, and while they are toasty warm, immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour, and voila, they will now fit perfectly!Grade: A-</review_text>
Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow</review_text>
Great service.  The shoes were just what I wanted.  I highly recommend these walking shoes because they are light weight and comfortable</review_text>
This set is guaranteed to make your partner stop and take notice!  Plus, you will enjoy wearing this silky, sensuous set to liven up your evening.  The fit is fantastic.  Not much is left to the imagination</review_text>
Plugged into Ipod and guess what! Audio and video came out the other end! A little spendy but what can ya do</review_text>
These boots are GORGEOUS! I got such an awesome deal on these boots; I searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them! I'll put one up here. They're comfy, rich leather, well made. I've always wanted Frye boots</review_text>
These are, by far, the most comfortable boots I have ever owned! I am a huge fan of Dansko clogs, and these Frye boots are just as comfortable and sturdy! They run a bit on the large side, about a half size difference. You will love them!!!!</review_text>
I just got these and love them.  My only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow, even though I don't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes.  The dark red color is a little deeper than the picture, but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer.  If you're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available, these are a great choice</review_text>
The socks were nice but cost too much .  Price a little unreasonable</review_text>
Calvin Klein provides a fashionable, comfortable underwear. Tight but not too tight, it holds you in place, while not constricting you to a tight position. Excellent, but don't buy them too little</review_text>
These trunks are great.  The pouch in the front works great in keeping everything together and comfortable.  I drive alot, and these are by far the best underwear I have ever had.Just be sure to order one size larger than you usually wear, otherwise they will be skin tight (unless you want that)</review_text>
This mask attached using some Velcro in the rear.I love it because it can be removed or put on without taking off my helmet!At first I had some problems with my glasses fogging up, what I did was just pull it extra tight until the material was very snug with my cheeks. This drastically reduced fogging. I read on another products review that using some medical tape below the eyes would eliminate fogging (on a similar product)Overall this has been a great buy.Nic</review_text>
This bra fits very well (I found it fit very true to size) and offers great support.  I'd much rather pay this price than the outrageous prices I've paid for sports bras in the past that have offered no where near the support.  It has held up well while jogging.</review_text>
Very smooth transaction and timely delivery.  First time on-line shoe buyer.  I tried those cute shoes on at a local shoe store and loved them but was not willing to pay high price for them.  I saved about 35% by purchasing here!</review_text>
This is the best sports bra I've ever had!  I show dogs for a hobby and was always aware that, as I gaited the dog around the ring, I was bouncing!  Now, no more bounce and extreme comfort.  I've had the bras for over 6 months now and they've held up well.  Everyone that I've recommended the bra to has had similar experiences</review_text>
This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!I have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. I hestitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them.When they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Try and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes.I was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. My next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was estatic! What a great product!!I have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. However the pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is what I have found...PROS------1) Attaches securely2) Removes with VERY little or no pain3) No residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed.4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra.6) Washable and reusable7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts.8) When properly applied you will not leak9) Peace of mind10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use.CONS-------1) If not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rinse them and then reapply properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaked during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other. My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me.2) If you own cats/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort3) Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it, it woudn't even make the con list anymore.4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I DO wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed.As you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. The cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. If you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!</review_text>
I regained my sanity after getting these. Sooooo much nicer than disposables</review_text>
Ditto... I bought more of these.Love the bibs with vinyl backings and absorbant terry fronts... really stops the soakings that happen with little ones who are teething. I bought these for a very low price that couldn't be beat. Nice quality</review_text>
This is truly a beautiful bag!  I got the classic dark leather, which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures.  The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character.  The leather is thicker than I expected; while it is by no means stiff, it is not ultra-soft, ultra-thin butter leather.  This is leather that will age well and last for many, many years.  The zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather, they'll be durable.  (The other hardware is the same type of matte/antiqued silver.)  The bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap.  The cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness, it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) Inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag.  One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; I would have really liked for my iPod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit.  The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook, file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I've tried because they were sized for laptops. I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book. On the outside, each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it.  This creates 2 tall, thin pockets where I keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items, but that's not a problem for me.  The entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket.  On the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag.  The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong.  There are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag.  I've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments.  Though the bag is pricey, it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials.  It also has a very distinctive look.  I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List</review_text>
I received the earmuffs I ordered 3 days after I placed the order</review_text>
The earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter</review_text>
Our son was very pleased to get a leather jacket for Christmas. The proof is in the wearing!  He's been wearing it ever since.  Thanks for the great transaction!</review_text>
I love these boots! I got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect. I can fit pants in them or over them and I have not had a problem yet</review_text>
HESITANTLY, I ORDERED MY FIRST PAIR OF FOLK READERS; NOW I'M BACK FOR A SECOND PAIR. THEY'RE COMFORTABLE, UNIQUE, WELL-CRAFTED AND THE COMPANY OFFERS EXCELLENT SERVICE - A WINNER</review_text>

I've been looking for black sport socks for a long time!  Finally, a black comfortable, cushy sport sock of medium thickness.  I'm completely satisfied</review_text>
I find this store to be very accomodating.  Will definitely shop there again</review_text>
I am gratefully pleased with product and vendor . . . Very Pleased</review_text>
I bought this for my daughter.  She is into pink and camo???   Anyway it is a quality product and the daughter just loves it.  What more is there to say</review_text>
Tops and bottoms are very comfortable and able to keep me comfortably warm at +30F to +40F with regular Dockers and long-sleeve cotton/polyester shirt.  They are lighter and less bulky than their all-cotton longjohn cousins designed for similar temperatures.  They also dry much more quickly.As with all longjohns I have found on the market in the past forty-plus years, the tops are too short for anyone much taller than 6'(now) or 6'2" (back then).  Sadly, I never see them listed in "Tall Sizes," and, as always before, I have to tuck in the tops or hike up the bottoms over and over and over...to make sure my waist is protected.</review_text>
I love the sweatshirt! It came exactly as pictured and in time for me towear it for the Super Bowl</review_text>
I originally wanted the Orange colored Tsubos, but they were out of stock, so I decided to go with the pickle color. I absolutely love em! The comfort and style are unique and satisfying. It is because of shoes like this I have become a shoe expert of sorts</review_text>
Seriously, went into the store to find new running shoes, possibly the air 360.  Was wearing shoxs in the store.  Threw them away immediately.  These are the best shoes I've worn in a long while.  I'm one of those ppl that like to take off my shoes as soon as I get home.  I forgot that these were on, they were that comfortable.  I'm a heavy, parttime runner.  Nothing over 5K as I am just starting again.  They support my weight extremely well</review_text>
Even if you could never see yourself wearing this. Go ahead and get it anyway.This is great for under the football helmet & for under the motorcycle helmet. Feels good on your head. I have even seen wrestlers wear these under headgear so it must be good for that too. keeps your head dry.I also wore this under my mask when volunteering @ a haunted house</review_text>
I have had these boots for one month, winter in Alaska.  I have been climbing a 1,000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long.  It is winter, the temperatures range from 5F to 25F and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice.  I am wearing one pair of medium weight SmartWool socks and no gaters.  To date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots.  Lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots.  The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected.  The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!).  For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).  Light weight, but strong and sterdy so far.  Felt completely broke in right out of the box.  Not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down.  I would highly recommend them so far</review_text>
I HAVE NEVER BEEN INTO FULL RIM HATS. I NEEDED ONE FOR THE WORK AND REST I DO SO I GAMBLED ON THIS. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I DID. IT FITS PERFECTLY, AND ALREADY I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A TWENTY DEGREE DIFFERENCE WITH RAIN, AND BEING A GLASSES WEARER, I CAN SAY I AM DEFINITELY PLEASED. I RECOMMEND THIS HAT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON</review_text>
Tis jacket is super handsome and is very comfortable. The stitching in the sleeve had to be mended but that was an easy fix. GOOD DEAL</review_text>
I am so in love with these jeans. I made myself a promise that when I buy jeans again, these are definitely the brand jeans I will be purchasing!! I am very pleased with the L.E.I. jeans to the full extent!!</review_text>
The zipper pulls are somewhat ill-suited for the job, the only way I found to be able to zip the boots up quickly, easily and snuggly was to replace the zipper pull with a key chain</review_text>
i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week</review_text>
These are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs I've found that are actually designed with a "pouch", making them the most comfortable on the market (of all the brands I've tried, that is). Unfortunately, they're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets, and you'll probably have to purchase them from an Amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges, but what can I say. I guess it's worth it.The briefs also run about a size small. I have a 31" waist but the mediums are too small.</review_text>
These shoes are so light that sometimes I forget I have them on. They are so  comfortable than I don't want to take them off. I have to walk a lot every day and I am not kidding when I said that any other pair of shoes make my feet sore after a few hours of use, but these shoes do the job to perfection.I highly recommend them</review_text>
They are very nice and comfortable. I just advise ordering a size larger than you are used to</review_text>
I ordered this shirt hoping it matched 5 others I had bought at a storefor my wedding party. I called the company, they explained the shirt in detail. I ordered it and received it promptly, and it was a perfect match.Thank Yo</review_text>
I bought my wife the set and she loves it, everything from Figleaves has beed great</review_text>
I first saw this WebUndies outfit when my friend Sara brought them to our lingerie party and I have to admit, with all the other hot looking stuff there, I didn't have too much hope for these. Well, was I ever wrong. You don't need to be skimpy and revealing to be attractive to your man. These will do the trick. If your guy hasn't been paying you the kind of attention you've been wanting, get a pair of these, wear them to bed like pjs, climb under the covers, roll over pretend to go to sleep. I'm betting he won't let ya</review_text>
I love these running shoes.  They have a great look and they feel great, too. They fit my feet perfectly</review_text>
I purchasese the red ones, and I love them. They really go well with many different colors. I was really pleasantly surprised</review_text>
The Carhartt A110 Cold Weather Merino Wool Socks were a gift for my son.He has been very happy with them, keeping him very warm in the cold of Wyoming and Colorado.  I would definitely buy another pair for him and maybe for myself</review_text>
Just received a pair of these Deer Stags from my father, really, never heard of them before.  They are the most comfortable "dress" shoe I have ever worn.  Good for around the office, on the factory floor or in the field.  Slip resistant too</review_text>
The New Balance Men's M587 Running Shoe has been an excellent running shoe.  It has a built in rollbar that prevent shin-splints and the shoes are extremely comfortable to run-in.  I have been buying this shoe for over four years and two deployments to Iraq.  I recommend this shoe to any runner that runs 4-5 times a week.</review_text>
HAD TO SEND BACK THE FIRST PAIR BECAUSE I NEEDED A BIGGER SIZE. RECEIVED THE SECOND PAIR AND CREDIT FOR THE FIRST PAIR PROMPTLY. THIS PAIR IS JUST RIGHT!!! WILL DEFINATELYORDER AGAIN. THANKS</review_text>
These are the best slippers I have ever owned!!! They cradle your feet in super soft memory foam. When I get home from work everyday, I slide my feet into them and am instantly relaxed. I love these slippers!!! The best ever... after much wear, I will buy another pair!</review_text>
No Complaints. Everything ran smoothly. I recommend this seller and this product to everyone. They are absolutely great, and they were exactly as described/pictured</review_text>
This jacket is well-made, stylist and goes with a range of skirts and slacks. Great addition to a professional wardrobe</review_text>
These are nice sweatshirts.  Good quality and the prices is half what you might pay for a Champion brand.  It is oversized so order your normal size and don't count on much shrinkage</review_text>
I am technically a 32JJ (per some lingerie store lady), but have worn 34 DD and DDD since high school (I'm 27 now) and have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra (33 weeks pregnant today). I tried the "Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra" in a 34G and 34H. This one is the most supportive, but is an underwire (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the "Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra," which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.).So, regarding the Goddess bra - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). My favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty supportive, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela - but steps above the Fancee Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in.This bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write. Hope you find the same success with this bra, too. Good Luck</review_text>
This bra is the best nursing bra I have found.  It is very supportive and comfortable.  I like that it gives you the same support as an underwire bra but without the hard wire digging into you.  It holds up very well in the wash.  I would definitly recommend this bra to anyone that has a hard time finding bras to fit them.</review_text>
This is a great item to have if you are loosing weight.  You can adjust the belt as needed without having to buy new ones</review_text>
Very pleased with all aspects of this transaction. Price, delivery and quality all excellent. Recommend seller highly</review_text>
This is a great swimsuit but if your buns are out of shape don't buy since that is what is showing the most. I think it would rate a 5 if it wasn't lined like previous speedos</review_text>
These shoes are different from anything else I have ever owned.  I truely love wearing them.  They are comfortable, practical and they make me smile every time I wear them!  Order a 1/2 size larger than your usual size and have some fun</review_text>
Great boots.  Perfect for playing in the rain.  Great Quality.  I bought one size bigger that current size so they would last at least two rainy season.  No problems for the kiddos to adjust to bigger size.  We previously had the frog boots and they are still in great shape to be hand-me-downs</review_text>
Incredible boot!  Comfort, style and warmth have proved their way with this boot.  I get positive comments each time I wear them!  The tread is perfect for walking in snow pack too.  You don't slide a bit.  I'll enjoy these for years</review_text>
This is the most comfortable sports shoe that I have worn and I own just about every brand made</review_text>
I find this a very comfortable bra for women of larger sizes.</review_text>
I love the Garrick sandal. It was exactly what I expected as seen in the stores. Delivery, and service was excellent</review_text>
I'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers.  I run around the house in socks.  I'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold, plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop, turn on the water for a tree or plant, etc... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes.  These slippers are VERY soft, but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry.  The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however, but so far I've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such (laugh with me).  Yes I'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up</review_text>
I used this pair to replace my regular large fins. Speedo fins worked quite effectively and gave me a good workout. The material is also good/strong. I have no gripes about this product. I will highly recommend to people who do not like to use regular-size fins</review_text>
Very satisfied with my purchase. The item was a Christmas present for my son and they got here in plenty of time and fit perfect. Amazon was the only place I could find the shoes in stock and the price was also lower than any other site</review_text>
Does the job as described.  Recommend this brand.  DOwnst fall apart or rip after a couple of wears</review_text>
I have started water walking in the fitness center pool and found i was slipping enough  to bother me.  This shoe fits like a glove and is very inexpensive to use.  I would recommend it to anyone desiring to use it for this purpose or any other water related activity.  I am certain it would be great at the beach, etc</review_text>
This is a great pair of shoes and a good to have n your collection.It is a subtle silver and looks absolutely delicate on your feet.BUT it is one size smaller than normal.I usually wear a 8.5M and this turned out to be small for me.I do fit into it but my toe juts out a little bit.A 9M would have been better.But I dont have the patience to return it,so I am gonna keep it.Its a lovely pair of shoes</review_text>
I wear this shirt waiting tables and I reccomend it to anyone.  When washed it is wrinkle free and can survive many washings.  The larger size is very roomy and sleeve length is appropriate for long arms.  I only wish it came in a broad collar instead of just a point color, but still an excellent shirt</review_text>
This is my favorite for lap swims.  Reasonable modesty, but not baggy.  You'll move through the water with ease with minimum suit slippage.  If you are not looking for a tan, get this one!</review_text>
I bought two of these as a gift for my husband.  He'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed.  These were ready to go right out of the box, no assembly required, took up less space in his closet than the 3-4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had, and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from.  The cushioned tie "hooks" ensure the ties will not slip off, and also that they will not be damaged.  A breeze to organize his vast tie collection.  And he's loving this product</review_text>
The shoes are awesome...my daughter LOVES them! Business was done in a professional manner and was an easy transaction</review_text>
I found that these shorts do run a little bit small in size so make sure you give yourself an extra size up to make sure there is adequate room to move freely. Follow the care label for the first wash or two until they get broke in because the shorts are bit stiff at first due to their Scotchgaurding.TIP: Make sure you wash them before you wear them.I would recommend these shorts for most anyone who is looking for durability, comfort, and/or needing a professional look in the garments they wear.NOTE: If you are looking for extra pockets go the Dickies cargo route. These do not have any extra pockets</review_text>
I still love this bra!  It's great for casual wear, sleeping etc.  It does solve the back fat problem, however there is no lift and separate for me.  I'm going to try the underwire version of this bra to see if it helps.  It is an extremely comfortable bra that feels great on!  I bought a L for the band size, but there's just not quite enough coverage for my Ds</review_text>
Classic wedding tuxedo. Excellent fabric and cut. The tuxedo was changed to single breasted suit after my approval.</review_text>
Nice sock, but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough, in my opinion, to be considered plus size.   I will probably pass these on to my sons, who wear 8 men's size.</review_text>
I purchased this bre several weeks ago and found it to be the most confortable top I've worn to date. Since then I have purchased 4 more</review_text>
this cologne is the perfect balance of wood and sweetness. It is not overpowering, and it is very masculine. I bought it for my boyfriend, and found that on him it's even more potent! It's aa great fragranc</review_text>
This case is so cute and matches my green iPod perfectly.  I read other reviews that said it leaves little black fuzz on the iPod, but I haven't had that problem.  The belt clip works great with this and feels very secure.  The other review said the cut-out for the wheel is off a little, and I guess she is right.  Looking at it you can see just slightly that the wheel isn't centered, but it is completely accesible and I have no trouble using it.  Overall I love this case</review_text>
I bought this for my husband and am so impressed.  Nice and thick, and incredibly soft and huggable.  I have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores. The attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise.  Sturdy shipping box, and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required.  There was even a hand-written thank you note included.  I am more than satisfied.</review_text>
The megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes. It has a nice feel to it. The bathrobe is made of Japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100% cotton. Cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable. I purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if I had the choice to do so.</review_text>
This is a heavy/thick robe, I expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly. I am 5'8" and the sleeves are only slightly to long but, I don't even notice now. The comfort level is amazing, this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed. I cant speak on durability as I've only had it for a month or so but, you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel. I got the brown color and I love it, I feel like grisly adams in this thing..</review_text>
My son's favorite color is orange but finding an orange lunch bag this year was a tough find until I found this lunch kit.  It is perfect:  high qualtiy, great price, fast delivery.  I am completely satisfied and will definately order again next year</review_text>
At first I was bugged by how sticky this was, but boy did it work! They gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital (and charged me $9 for it, but that's another story!) It moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing, and doesn't bother baby a bit. Take my advice, bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over-charged!</review_text>
I pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running.  I not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but I ran two half marathons and the NYC Marathon with this exact sneaker.  When they became worn from the wear and tear?  I bought another pair - exact one.  These sneakers lasted me half a training season PLUS the marathon.  Not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles.  I highly recommend them.  And the color is fun, too</review_text>
I ordered the cranberry watch cap and the matching scarf for my daughter for Christmas. She loved the set as it is light weight and not bulky for packing for her honeymoon. The great choice of colors made it difficult to choose only one</review_text>
I have the gown too and ordered the PJ's from the direct website.They are the same great quality and the bottoms are so cute, I wear them all the time out of the house</review_text>
See title. these shoes are simply the best pair of foot protectors ive ever owned. so comfortable,  waterproof and just sweet-looking. i feel like a ninja every time i wear them</review_text>
Mom was looking for a similar item, from "Bass".  I told her this brand was very reliable.  She can put them down</review_text>
this item was a great buy,fast delivery and was given as a gift...thank</review_text>
Shirt really made a "hit".   Arrived shortly after placing order</review_text>
These are absolutely the most fashionable and adorable shoes on earth. They are right on the mark. I love them so much that I am ordering my second pair..not because the first fell apart, but because I simply have to have more than one pair</review_text>
I got my Adidas Adissage WHT/PNK sandals in record time. I was able to take them on my trip with me as intended. Also, the price was the best that I had seen on the internet.</review_text>
really nothing to say about this product...fast shipping, good deal.i like the style and the color. not too loud</review_text>
I've been wearing this bra for years.  It just can't be matched for comfortable fit, no wires, no seams. Whatever your shape you can &quot;shake yourself&quot; into it</review_text>
these boots are a great alternative to the military style combat boot. and the cost is less then when i purchased similar style boots when on active dut</review_text>
I missed my late 80s over the knee suede boots, which is why I got these. They are great! The only thing that could be much improved are the soles and heel. They are very thing. I'd wear them out in a day. I had to have them resoled. But the Ammazon price was so good it was still a steal.</review_text>
This was exactly what my husband had admired in Macy's.  I paid $25 more for the convenience of having it delivered to my home without my husband's knowledge.  He is thrilled with the jacket</review_text>
My 9 year old nephew told me he wanted "Under Armour" for Christmas. I had no idea what he was talking about. I asked - "Under arm deoderant"? "Undershirt"? I was ever the un-cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted. I found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing. ;)  The shirt runs very tight, and even though my nephew is smaller for his age, the large just barely fit him. He asked for a second one for his birthday (and so did my sister, so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it). The kid loves it, and if he gives it 5 stars, so do I.</review_text>
These boots are comfortable but they don't keep my feet very warm in cold weather. They have an unusual pattern that gets a lot of compliments and goes with almost every color in a wardrobe. The heel height is perfect. Also, I can tuck my jeans into the boots - an added bonus</review_text>
It's October 8th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.The Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.The celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.This Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area.</review_text>
The Tiffany's version is super expensive. These are clean and simple. They get the job done</review_text>
I initially recieved my order very quickly, within a week in fact. However, it was the wrong size and I had to send it back to them. It turned out it was another 6 weeks before I got back the correct fitting corset. The good news is with my wedding dress, it is perfect, however, if you are planning a wedding, make sure you get this item way ahead of time in case there are any issues with sizing or back ordering</review_text>
My wife has been looking for a pair of seamed pantyhose and didn't think such a thing existed. Last week she wore this pair to a re-enactment and received many favorable comments. Highly recommende</review_text>
Finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating, large-breasted women is no fun, but this dress is pretty good.  What this will not give you is any kind of coverage.  If you're ok with people seeing you with Major cleavage, then this is fine.  If not, just wear it to bed--not in the hospital or, as I see some women do--out of the house.  Yikes!  I think I'd be arrested</review_text>
looks very nice, material is not bad..just a little big from my original siz</review_text>
This is a really comfortable, and it's very protective, especially in high winds.  It keeps you war, and it looks good,  i personally added new patches to my jacket, its looks really good!!!  This is a good buy!!  You should get this Jacket</review_text>
i liked the book it was good but not as i expected, i needed more explanation before buying the book, like how the book will look like from the inside ,anyhow in general its goodThank you Amazo</review_text>
With the sale and promotional rate applied. This is a great shoe</review_text>
I bought these for my granddaughter after I saw her wearing a pair of plain black rubber boots[which she loved]!When I gave her these, she absolutely loved them!They are so cute, with flowers and butterflies all over them.They run true to size, are well made,  and look so bright and cheerful on a rainy day.Needless to say, the black boots have been retired</review_text>
I love the look and they are very comfortable on my feet. I got the black and white, and I love them with a pair of capris or long shorts</review_text>
The denim on these jeans is lightweight and the touch of stretch renders them super-comfy, not confining like some stretchy jeans can be. They're almost as comfortable as my sweats, and there are some weekends when I just live in these! True to size, and I didn't have the shrinking issue another reviewer seems to have experienced</review_text>
I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me. This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it. The shoes were very comfortable from the day one.One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. I worked out fine for me, however, because I had purchased 1/2 size longer than what I usually wear.Overall, I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it</review_text>
IF YOU PURCHASE THIS SLIPPER FOR YOUR MAN, HE WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER.  THEY NOT ONLY LOOK GREAT AND VERY EXPENSIVE, THEY ARE SUPER COMFORTABLE AND HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES WEARING THEM.  THEY LOOK GOOD ENOUGH TO WEAR TO THE SUPERMARKET.  BARBRA WILLI</review_text>
My son loves the shoes.  They are comfortable and very stylish.  They do not show dirt like other shoes.  They look to be made well and designed very nice too</review_text>
I am very pleased with the terry wrap that I bought as a Christmas gift.  I had looked in every store I was in while Christmas shopping for one but found none so was very pleased to find this one.  It is well made, looks good and the price was great.  Shipping was very quick without paying extra for express service</review_text>
I love the shoes, very comfortable and i can wear them with just about anything</review_text>
These sandals are very nice and the price that I paid was a very  good price</review_text>
Great looking on my feet, extremely comfortable and the price for a suede sandal like this is phenomenal!  I'm going to order more.</review_text>
We have always bought stride rite shoes for our son, however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months! I was excited to find these here at such an awesome price. They are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them.</review_text>
Color and image are delightful. I do wish I had gone up a size as I like to wear it with a long sleeved t-shirt underneath</review_text>
I love these shoes! Tsubo is notoriously comfortable and these are amazing! They aren't the prettiest shoes in the world, but I can spend 12 hours on my feet in them and my feet are happy</review_text>
These fit a tiny bit loose but the comfort level is great.  Shoes at Amazon.com are one of my favorite on-line purchases, great prices</review_text>
Bought these for my 7 year old per his request. The size was right, the style was right and he has been wearing them everyday since. They arrived quicker than anticipated and we are very happy with the purchase</review_text>
Very good quality, nice leather, sturdy, and can be used for anything. Big enough as a book bag, great carry on, a purse...etc. I am very satisfied with my purchase....the bag is made in the states, and a great price, for a quality made item. I highly recommend this leather bag</review_text>
If you have the body to show for it, by all means wear it alone</review_text>
Great leggings....I love the feel of these....thicker than the regular cotton/lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely.....One thing I like about Danskin is the waist elastic is not tight, it just rests on your waist. It's extremely comfortable. Gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus...I wear these to yoga, pilates, on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else. Oh, and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings......I even wear them in 90 degree weather. I just can't get enough of them......I have always appreciated Danskin quality, just machine wash and dry and off you go....</review_text>
This shoes are very lovely, classy and comfortable. I'm thinking of getting them in another colour</review_text>
Exactly as advertised. If you're a Naruto nut, or like wristbands, I'd advise buying this</review_text>
Warm and soft. I have used this brand for years and they have never caused skin problems. This brand is warmer then those without the fuzzy inside</review_text>
I had bought a bra of this model at a discount store, just got lucky.  It quickly became my favorite, and I was glad to find it at Amazon.</review_text>
The shoes are great.  I love Dansko, they are the most supportive and comfortable shoes that I have ever worn.  I have 9 pair & will buy more.  The retailer was great.  I received my shoes within 5 days & I would shop there again.</review_text>
My favorite underwear right now, the pima cotton is very soft.  If you want an alternative to boxer briefs, these are great. If you are kinda between sizes, round up</review_text>
I like this fragance and the shipment was awsome,I didn't know what they supose to be here and when i check de tracking it was like delivered and I check my mail and it was there!AWSOME AWSOME AWSOM</review_text>
The bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater.  Material is good for both the t-shirt and hoodie.  For the quality and price, can't beat it anywhere</review_text>
I got custom fit for this bra at Nordstrom's and I am so happy that I purchased it - among others that day. I had lost 55 pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about 4 bra sizes on my way down. Hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra. It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a "light" 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C. Plus it gives me a "bump" and just the right amount of cleavage. I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed. It took a bit to get used to "them" being so "out there in front." So if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you. I love it so much that I now have this in all 3 colors and 2 of the bare color as I am very fair skinned.</review_text>
I'm a big guy. Heck, I'll just admit; I'm a fat guy. However, I am also simply large-framed (broad-shouldered, barrel-chested). I got the largest size possisble to accomodate my stomach and my large chest (largest available is a chest measurement of 60, my chest is 58), and while the coat looks pretty good on me, the shoulders are extremely constricting and I have heard the seam in the back pulling if I move my arms too quickly or too far. If you have unusual proportions like me, I reccomend biting the bullet and getting a tailor-made coat elsewhere. Still, though, the coat is quite warm and looks pretty nice on me, so if you are of relatively normal dimensions, you can add a star to this review when considering a purchase</review_text>
This boonie hat is collapsible, yet has a firm rim. Chin-strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds. This is the hat that will conceal you in the woods, but gets noticed about town. The digital pattern is impressive can often times is a conversation piece. I wear it almost every day, and it's my favorite piece of headgear</review_text>
Sexy and well made. I am a size 12, but I bought the queen size and it fit great</review_text>
The glasses were in excellent condition, they were exactly what i expected plus more (they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me.  This was an excellent seller</review_text>
i am picky about the kind of sock i put on me & my son's feet. his feet have been sized as extra wide (!!) and these socks fit wonderfully, in his size, without being stretched tight. i love the high cotton content & the cushioned soles. these are well made socks & i will be buying from this brand when it's time for the next size up</review_text>
trans. was great. love the shirt!! I know it's a lot for a t-shirt, but I had to have it!!</review_text>
A really nice looking t-shirt that was made to show an archeological digrevealing an unearthed artifact (a Gibson Les Paul Guitar).  I've had nothing but positive remarks about it every time it was worn. I'll probably order another because something this good usually goes fast.A really good Led Zep shirt is hard to find and this is one.Highly reccomended.  5 stars.</review_text>
Not only are these shoes great looking on...they are extremely comfortable.  I went back and bought two addtional pairs in different colors</review_text>
These are the most comfortable boots I've ever had straight out of the box.  They look good and feel even better.  Highly recommended!!!</review_text>
i ordered this for my son for his birthday.they told me it was backordered i was so afraid he wouldnt have it for his birthday.i sent them a email and they answered right away,i emailed them one day and had the present 2 days later.even through this is a small company they took care of a long time customer now</review_text>
THis is a great additional purchase to the Princess costumes.  Just know for little fingers (children) they are hard to put on - requires parental assistance</review_text>
Got these slippers for my man for Christmas. They are buttery soft, the fit is true to size and they are not lined with something to heavy and hot for the feet. Can be worn barefoot or with socks. Great for a quick dash outside. I would recommend these slippers and this seller</review_text>
Rubber boots don't have to look like booring rubber boots. I ordered Women's Tan "Beach Holiday" boots for my daughter as a Christmas present. They arrived in time for Christmas and she loves them</review_text>
