1	... but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one , and alpha video , the distributors of this classic capra movie , made no attempt to clean it up . here we have an example of a key artwork about america 's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s , crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves
1	the royal tenenbaums is wes anderson 's third major motion picture . the movie revolves around a rich , but extremely eccentric man name royal tenenbaum ( gene hackman ) . royal and his wife etheline ( angelica huston ) had three children : chas ( ben stiller ) , margot ( gwyneth paltrow ) , and richie ( luke wilson ) . in the 1970s the tenenbaums were one of america 's premier families : margot was a famous playwright , richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive u.s. nationals , and chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen . that was almost thirty years ago and the tenenbaums have largely been forgotten . betrayal , failure , and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died . what 's worse is that royal 's children and wife blame him for all their failures . royal senses that his time is earth is waning and he wishes to set things right . with the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend , pagoda ( kumar pallana ) , royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family 's eyes . i 'm a pretty big fan of wes anderson and have seen all four of his films . the royal tenenbaums is anderson 's most critically acclaimed and his most popular picture . however , it is my least favorite of his movies . like all anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and witty dialogue . the film is about the redemption of a man in the eyes of his family , a theme that i enjoy . yet , the film just did n't resonate with me as much as anderson 's other pictures . i really do n't know why that is . that 's not to say the royal tenenbaums is a bad movie because it 's not . in addition to everything else mention it also has some good acting , brilliant set designs , etc . i just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a sea-voyaging documentarian instead
0	this film is boring , so much so that i could only take 35 minutes of it before i was forced to push stop . this is a soap opera about politics oil companies . it 's weird jump around style is confusing pointless ... do yourself a favor and do n't bother w/ this garbage
0	my daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school . it was n't until years later that i saw it , and i was horrified ! ! ! this was a movie aimed at children ? ? ? what does a children 's movie need a sexy bunny for ? the lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and `` strutting her stuff '' on the basketball court in a very provocative manner , until the male characters were panting , drooling , and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick , depraved perverts . this scene was highly innapropriate for children , and is not the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls . not only that , the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities . this movie should be kept far , far away from children , and was truly deserving of zero stars
1	of course dead alive was the better movie . but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate , due to the fact that there is a high body count , lots of over-the-top splattery deaths , and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers , some as zombie lunch . apparently there was some footage cut out for this release . i 'm not sure if that was gore footage or not , but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence . there is even some non-gore `` grossout '' humor ( vomit-related , etc . ) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive . sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground , but again the influence is unquestionable . do n't expect the fx quality of dead alive though , this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly . i do n't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print/transfer , but it 's a minor distraction . they did a great job with a relatively small budget . i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach 's other films on us ( hopefully uncut ) dvd release -- i 've heard burning moon is especially crazy
0	this is an excellent film , which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor . i was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor , inter-titles appear to be missing , and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that do n't match the action on-screen . it 's a shame , because a film like this one deserves much better
0	while i absolutely love the show on pbs , this season was mispackaged . the box and dvd were both labeled series 3 , but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1/2 . unfortunately , i did n't try watching this disc until several months after i bought it . if you buy this , be sure you view it promptly to be certain it 's the correct series
0	even though i am not a streisand fan , i was astonished at just how dopey and annoying this movie was . the plot is supposed to revolve around a big change in appearance for streisand 's character , making her attractive - no , irresistible - to the main male character . the problem is , she looks almost exactly the same before and after the makeover ! somebody ( probably streisand ) thinks that highlighted hair , a tight black cocktail dress , and a baggy-lipped smirk are irresistible whereas a pink bridesmaid dress , casual clothes , and everyday looks are disgusting . baaaaaamp ! ( that 's the fallacy alarm going off : men , in my experience , do n't care much about clothes and makeup . ) there was a lot of emphasis placed on the streisand character 's losing weight by riding an exercise bike , but she looked exactly the same afterward - no detectable weight difference ! yet truly , the low point of the movie is the scene in which streisand , discussing her baby and early-childhood photos with her mother ( played by lauren bacall ) , blubbers , `` wazz i a pretty baby ? wazz i a pretty babyyyyeeee ? '' in that one scene , streisand 's neuroticism concerning her looks is fully revealed . the whole movie is about this issue , and it 's amazing that an entire cast , crew , and production company would devote themselves to b.s . 's emotional issues like that . i really think that the `` funny girl '' phenomenon somehow ruined streisand 's thought processes . the media buzz about her at the time was that she was kind of cute despite being light-years away from the stereotyped , northern european beauty standard of the time ( think grace kelly ; think ingrid bergman ... .. ) . i recall reading about how her glowing complexion , thick hair , and good figure ( as well as her energy and voice ) carried her through despite her looks : long nose , large lips , slanted eyes . myself , i think she looks like an egyptian princess or similar ; but she certainly does n't look like grace kelly ... .. so why ca n't she accept this ? the majority of us women , whatever our race , color , or bone-structure , learn to live with and love who we are ... ..at least i hope we do ! this movie is not about that . this movie says that you have to have a certain dress and hairdo to be desirable . maybe i should 've given it only one star
1	'fais-moi des vacances ' ( we need a vacation ) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in france while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads . directed and written by didier bivel ( with writing assistance from djamila djabri ) it offers a slice of life we rarely see - that underbelly of france 's projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods . lucien ( aymen saïdi ) lives with his father ( bernard blancan ) , mother ( hiam abbass ) , young sister pamela ( laura mas navarro ) , and his tough streetwise older brother josé ( nabil el bouhairi ) in a small flat . close by is his african friend adama ( ibrahim koma ) and his equally poor family of father ( makan fofana ) , mother ( marie-philomène nga ) and sister fanta ( hawa yakaré sissoko ) . as school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation , a state neither lucien nor adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury . the two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a ruv of a family headed for the beach . but despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van 's owners , the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp , a fact that makes them flee ! upon returning home both boys ' families punish their activities and when lucien seeks comfort from his older brother , josé beats him and tells him to grow up . in the end the boys finagle their way to the beach , but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re-evaluating their lives . the cast is uniformly strong , the writing is excellent , and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys ' imaginations . it is a fine little film , one deserving of a wide audience . grady harp , january 07
0	so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino , the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995 . this movie , and mira sorvino 's performance in it , was so bad that after it was over , i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category . let 's see ... ..according to wikipedia they were : kathleen quinlin ( `` apollo 13 '' - a fairly standard worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role ) , mare winningham ( `` georgia '' - did not see this one ) , joan allen ( `` nixon '' - did not see , but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon ? ) , and kate winslet ( `` sense and sensibilities '' - did not see either , but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also ) . it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today 's hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance . and i was beginning to warm up to her , too - she was great in `` romy and michele 's high school reunion '' , and terrific also in `` beautiful girls '' . so , what exactly is so bad about this movie ? here 's a brief list : 1 . mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking . another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard . maybe in 1995 , because she was new , the academy did n't realize that this was n't her real voice and took pity on her ... . 2 . stupid plot device of the greek chorus . 3 . stupid happy ending with a twist . 4 . lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies ... ..while this movie is not itself a porn flick , the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch . 5 . odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen ( with dyed hair and bald spot ) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters ... ..all right , so i 'm just jealous - woody still looks gross ... . 6 . cliched , poorly developed characters , a plotline that goes around in circles , and lots and lots of pointless , unfunny dialogue . in summary , this movie is bad , bad , bad ... ...
